IT'S still winter and the country has been blasted by snow this week - but Primark is already getting into the summer spirit.
Eagle-eyed shoppers have spotted some new arrivals at the store this week with a fan-favourite making an exciting return.
Sharing news of the summer items dropping in stores, Primark bosses said: "Our seamfree co-ords are coming back with new colourways, all pieces £4 each."
They also revealed that new-in swimwear is in stock with prices from £2.50.
Fashion fanatic Ellie Butler, the girlfriend of Celtic's Liam Shaw, gave fans a look at the new stock in a TikTok video.
She said: "Primark new in! The summer bits have started to come in too."
And shoppers are going wild for the summer looks.
One said: "Omg seamless shorts are back."
A second wrote: "Yes Primark, ready for a holiday now."
A third agreed: "Primark knows we all need a holiday."
While a fourth joked: "do I need anymore bikinis? No.. but am I gunna get some? Yes."
But January's plummeting temperatures have meant the new stock has got a frosty reception from some social media users, as one asked: "Already?!?!"
Another wrote: "It's January", accompanied by the crying emoji.
A third added: "There’s too much colour in for me atm."
Meanwhile, a fourth said: "It’s still winter, remember that lol."
