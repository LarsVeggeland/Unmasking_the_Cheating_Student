AN outspoken young woman has bared it all by refusing to wear a bra in front of her mom and the public. 
The self-described "it girl" has been categorized as bold online for her behavior. 
TikTok creator Aubree Conway (@aubreeyawnoc) uses her social media presence to draw attention to serious issues but in a comical way. 
The brunette never shies away from being her authentic self and that includes when she's around family.
In 
, she brought her brazen personality and relationship with her mother to the forefront.
Conway shared an interaction with her mom, where she told Conway to put a bra on and she refused. 
At the start of the video, the 19-year-old stood in her living room while her mother sat on a recliner chair behind her. 
She wore low-slung gray sweatpants and a stylish long-sleeve green and white tank top on her lean body. 
It was apparent that she was not wearing a bra, so it makes sense that the subtitle over the visual read: "Put a bra on."
The phrase went perfectly with the mother-daughter interaction, which showed her mother annoyingly looking at her as Cowley dances. 
The song that the young woman danced to and mouthed along with is called Megan's piano by rapper Megan Thee Stallion.
"Sorry, h**s hate me 'cause I'm the it 
," the singer said in the lyrics.
In a final move, the content creator flashed her bosom at her mother toward the end of the video.
People were taken aback by Cowley's actions and made their feelings known.
"GIRL REALLY FLASHED HER," one viewer commented. 
"Bold," another bluntly stated. 
"How you flag your mom I could never," a fan added.
"My mom would have kicked me two cities over," a person chimed in.
