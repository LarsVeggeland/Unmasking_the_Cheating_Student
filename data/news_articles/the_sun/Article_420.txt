DEAR DEIDRE: I LOVE my boyfriend but since the birth of our first child our sex life has disappeared.
We’ve been together almost five years and until recently enjoyed a healthy amount of intimacy, but now I feel he can’t bear to touch me.
I’m 38 and he’s only 31. Our son is four months old.
I put on quite a lot of pregnancy weight and still haven’t lost it all.
The night feeds have really taken a toll on me. 
I fear my weight gain and exhaustion might be the cause of all this.
Every problem gets a personal reply from one of our trained counsellors.

What if he doesn’t fancy me anymore?
Adapting to parenthood can be hard and as the focus shifts towards your baby’s needs it’s not uncommon for new parents to feel distant from one another.
Let your partner know how you feel and check in to see if everything is alright with him too. 
It’s important to keep communication open.
Be kind to your body and try to find time and ways to invite passion back into your relationship. 
I’m attaching my support pack Saving Your Sex Life.
