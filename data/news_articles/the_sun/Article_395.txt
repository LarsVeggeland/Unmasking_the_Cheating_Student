ROCHDALE star Ethan Ebanks-Landell saw a straight red for a horror tackle on Jack Hamilton.
The defender caught the Hartlepool star by the neck with an incredibly high boot in the 51st minute of the 
 fixture.
Hamilton was lucky to come away unscathed by the 30-year-old's boots.
Referee Marc Edwards was given very little choice but to show the Rochdale man a straight red card.
Losing Ebanks-Landell proved costly as three minutes later Josh Umerah scored for 
 to break the deadlock.
Hamilton would go on to get his revenge on the pitch as he double the host's leads in the 64th minute.
To compound the misery for 
, substitute Sam Graham was also sent for an early bath as he picked up two yellow cards in 31 minutes.
Some of the fans were fuming at Ebanks-Landell's decision to go for the ball in the manner he did.
One tweeted: "The decision making of some of our 'players' is baffling."
A second commented: "Stupid challenge, can't see us staying up."
A third wrote: "What a disgrace."
A fourth added: "Absolutely brain dead, so stupid."
