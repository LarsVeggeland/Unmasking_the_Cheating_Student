A TERROR chief who plotted to bomb the London Stock Exchange has lost a freedom bid.
Mohammed Shahjahan, 38, was ruled by a parole board as too dangerous to be released from 
.
He got 17 years in 2012 for the 
 inspired gun and bomb plot against 
 financial district.
The jihadi, from 
, was released in 2019 but recalled to prison for breaching licence conditions.
He pleaded his case for release last month but a prison psychologist ruled Shahjahan had a “tendency to overlook the consequences of his actions”.
Shahjahan had planned the proposed 
 outrage with 
, 28, and Nazam Hussain, 38.
All three admitted engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terror and were jailed.
Khan went on to kill Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, at an offender rehabilitation conference at the Fishmongers’ Hall in November 2019 before being shot dead by police on nearby 
.
On denying Shahjahan freedom, 
 MP Nigel Mills said: “This is the right decision.
“We don’t want these monsters walking the streets.”
