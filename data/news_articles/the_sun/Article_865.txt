The Red Devils travel to 
 on Sunday in a huge top-of-the-table clash.
But they will be without midfield lynchpin 
 of the season in Wednesday's 
.
The result leaves United eight points behind the Gunners and without one of their most important players for the trip to The Emirates.
That has annoyed De Gea, who took aim at the Premier League by questioning why 
 had to play mid-week.
He told Sky Sports: “Big blow to lose Casemiro for Sunday.
"I don’t get why Arsenal don’t play as we have to play in the same week & they don’t. 
"Now we are missing one of our best players, I don’t understand. 
"Now we miss him for a big game & it is a big loss for us.”
To make matters worse United should have had a penalty against Palace for a foul on Scott McTominay 
.
That would have given the Red Devils an opportunity to make it 2-0 and put the game to bed.
It is even possible 
 would not have got booked if that happened, as he may not have desperately lunged in to win the ball in order to protect such a slender 1-0 lead.
