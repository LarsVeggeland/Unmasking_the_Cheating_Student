LIONEL MESSI is NOT set to join Cristiano Ronaldo in Saudi Arabia this summer.
The former 
 ace penned a megabucks deal with Al-Nassr last month.
, 35, was recently 
 an astonishing Â£306-million-a-year contract offer from Al-Nassr's biggest rivals Al-Hilal.
General secretary of Saudi Arabia's Football Federation Ibrahim Alkassim, however, has poured cold water on the potential arrival of Messi in the Middle East.
He told Spanish paper 
: "At the moment we do not know anything about a possible Lionel Messi arrival.
"Although I do not hide that, as Saudi Federation, we would like to have him one day in the domestic league.
"The idea of the Federation is always to improve our football, and of course we would like to see 
 and Messi in the same league again.
"But the truth is that we don't know anything now."
Messi and Ronaldo recently faced off in a friendly between 
 and a Saudi All-Star team in Riyadh - both scoring as the French champions 
.
The Argentine has been strongly linked with David Beckham's MLS franchise 
, as well as former club 
.
But reports suggest that he is 
 with PSG.
It's understood that Messi is eager to add to his tally of four Champions League trophies before leaving European football.
PSG are set to face 
 in this year's round of 16.
A contract extension could be announced in the coming days.
