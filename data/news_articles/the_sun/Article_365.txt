AN INFLUENCER shocked her fans by posting an incredible transformation to her TikTok page. 
It wasn't the college-aged content creator who got a makeover, but her striking mom, who she labeled a "baddie."
Lily Rose Castillo (@castillolilyy) is clearly a social media success, since her style influence left an impression 
In a now-viral clip, 
 worthy of a night out, with hair, makeup, and accessories to match.
When Castillo's mother first walked onscreen, 
 and cute. 
Wearing slippers, leopard-print pajama pants, and a T-shirt, the mom gave a lovely, fresh-faced smile. 
After 
she walked into another room. 
When she re-emerged, she was decked out in her daughter's clothes. 
Castillo's mom played the part of a total diva, strutting in white, peep-toe sandals. 
She wore low-slung pants and a cropped bra top in the same shade. 
A pale pink purse gave her sophisticated edge, while sunglasses added a bit of celebrity flavor. 
And her new hairstyle – a high, tight bun with face-framing pieces – left the look totally polished.
Commenters fell all over themselves, trying to get the "in" with Castillo's mom.
"I want to be married to your mom, please," a man confessed, adding in prayer emojis to manifest his dreams.
"What’s mom’s e-mail?" a different desperate man asked.
Other commenters begged for Castillo to connect them to her mom on social media – or, better yet, encourage mom to join TikTok.
True fans said they loved Castillo's mom before her outfit change.
"Baddie from the moment she walked in," one insisted.
Another man said, "Even before she changed out of her jammies, I was into it."
