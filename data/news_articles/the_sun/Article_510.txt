 is pants with no support, so that’s what we’re going to try today.
"This is not easy to put on. Honestly, I feel so good. It was a struggle to put on, but I feel really good in it," Carliana said.

"I am out of breath. I am so out of breath but I feel snatched. I feel really good in this. I’m glad I got it," she told viewers.
The influencer concluded: "I commend Kim for this, I feel like they are really expensive but the quality shows up for the price."
TikTok users took to the comments section to share their thoughts on the shapewear.
"I have been influenced," wrote one viewer.
Another follower said: "The confidence/way you feel is the most important part."
"You’re servinggggg," commented a third person.
