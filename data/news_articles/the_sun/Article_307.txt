RIVERDANCE star Michael Flatley is facing demands for £1.8million after the collapse of his theatre business.
More than £350,000 of it is owed to 
 in unpaid taxes, a report by finance experts said.
The rest is due to various creditors as part of a “misfeasance” package, meaning he is accused of failing to manage his money properly.
Investigators are probing Marotiri West End Ltd, set up by Irish-American 
, 64.
It provided “support activities to performing arts”, but was closed by court order in 2016.
Liquidator Lloyd Hinton says in a report there was “inconsistency” and “various issues” in relation to payments made by the company.

.
Clenching his fist in an 
 post as he returned home he wrote: “Thank you to everyone around the world for your love and prayers. 
"I am overwhelmed by your kindness. I have been released from hospital and am on the mend.”

Flatley’s spokesman was contacted but declined to comment.
