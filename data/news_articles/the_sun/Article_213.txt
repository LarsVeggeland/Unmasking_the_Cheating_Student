CARL FROCH has questioned where Chris Eubank Jr's career will go now following his brutal defeat to Liam Smith.  
 hit the canvas for the first time as a professional in round four of his middleweight clash with Smith.  
And before long he was bundled to the deck again and despite once more making it to his feet, 
Froch, a former sparring partner, fears the loss could have massive consequences for Eubank and his career.  
He said on Sky Box Office: “Where does he go from here? That could be curtains on his career.
“And I don’t want to say he should retire now but that was a bad defeat. I just think, where does he go now?
“He’s in against a naturally smaller guy and he looked badly hurt.
“I don’t think he’ll retire but where does he go now at middleweight or super-middleweight?”
Eubank's dream of a middleweight title tilt against Kazakh legend Gennady Golovkin, 40, appear to have been KO'd.  
And until any sort of redemption in the ring is gained, a mega-fight with Mexican Canelo Alvarez, 32, has also been knocked back.  
Instead, Eubank, 33, could look to go behind enemy lines against Liverpool's Smith, 34,  
He said: “If the fans want to see a rematch, we can get it on at Anfield.”
Smith becomes the third man to beat Eubank, behind Billy Joe Saunders, 33, and George Groves, 34. 
And having come up in weight for the pay-per-view bout, he teased taking the potential sequel back to Merseyside.  
Smith said: "If Chris wants the rematch we can do that on my terms.
“I agreed to the rematch clause beforehand so we can see, I can beat all the best fights at 160lbs and 154lbs.”
