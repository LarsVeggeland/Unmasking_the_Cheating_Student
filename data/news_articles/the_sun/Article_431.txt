JAYNE Torvill has been all over our screen for the past few weeks, both choreographic and judging on Dancing on Ice.
She and fellow skating professional Christopher Dean have skated together for over four decades, and many think they're a couple.
However, they're just close friends and their chemistry remains strictly on the ice.
Christopher has been married a few times, to Isabelle Duchesnay from 1991-1993, Jill Trenary from 1994-2010, and he's been in a relationship with Karen Barber since 2011.
He has two children, Jack, 23, and Sam, 21.
Jayne has been with her husband, Phil Christensen, for over 30 years.
They have two children, Jessica and Kieran, who they adopted.
The Torvill-Christensen family live in a huge countryside home in East Sussex.
It's a perfect family abode, with a rustic, cosy feel to its interior.
Jayne is clearly a fan of wooden furnishings, as most of her home is decked out in the same oak wood.
Some parts of the home has stone flooring, and there's a clear nature theme going on throughout the house.
Jayne loves to share snaps from inside her home, and snaps from her own and her children's birthdays have revealed exactly what the inside of the family home looks like.
They have a large landscaped garden to the rear of the property, with a patio, perfect for sunny days.
