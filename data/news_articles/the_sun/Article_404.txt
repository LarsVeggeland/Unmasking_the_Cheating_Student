"It's really difficult not to be with Gorka because we're such good friends," Helen told The Sun. 
"I've been asking him for advice a lot, so it feels like he's here. I'd have loved for him to do it, but it's almost like he's in the group."
Meanwhile, Helen looked happier than ever as she enjoyed some quality time with her kids.
She could be seen smiling in the black and white snap, alongside her daughter Elsie, one, and her two sons Ernie, seven, and Louis, five.
The TV favourite posed on the floor while her kids leaped on her.
