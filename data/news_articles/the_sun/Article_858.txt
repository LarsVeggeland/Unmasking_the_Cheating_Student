DEAR DEIDRE: THE guy I have a huge crush on is messing with my head.
We’re both in college and he knows how I feel because my friend told him.
I’m 17 and he’s 18. Sometimes he 
 with me and other times he acts like he can’t get away quick enough.
Recently, we were out with mates, and someone took a picture.
He put his arm around me for it, then jumped away the second it was over. I felt humiliated. I’m so confused.
Every problem gets a personal reply from one of our trained counsellors.

You can also send a private message on the 
 Facebook page.
He might be sending mixed messages because he isn’t sure what he wants, or he’s immature and embarrassed.
Or perhaps he likes your attention but doesn’t want a relationship.
Ask your friend to have a word, to find out for sure where you stand. Or you could risk asking him out.
My support pack, Learning About Relationships, can help.
