DEAR DEIDRE: 
I inherited some money and since then my friend keeps asking me to lend to her so she can expand her property business.
I’m 71 and my friend is 65. 
I agreed to her first request for £51,000 on the condition she paid it back over a four-year period.
She hadn’t even cleared half that repayment before putting me on the spot over dinner with her husband and asking for another £22,000 on top! 
She and her husband both have decent jobs, but I’m retired and widowed and have finite funds.
Every problem gets a personal reply from one of our trained counsellors.

You can also send a private message on the 
 Facebook page.
She keeps cancelling plans since I said no. 
How can I be sure she will pay me back now?
Don’t let your friend guilt-trip you into lending her more money.
It’s never a good idea to lend money to friends or family that you can’t afford to lose.
If she stalls on repaying the existing loan, talk to Citizens Advice (
).
