CHRIS EUBANK JR is back in the ring this weekend as he takes on Liam Smith in a massive middleweight fight TONIGHT.
The Brighton man and his Liverpudlian opponent 
 in the lead up to their fight. 
 are looking to get into contention for world honours later this year - so both will be after a big win. 
Elsewhere on the card, heavyweight 
 returns to action against Brit Jack Massey. 
And 
 in a huge welterweight fight for the British and Commonwealth titles. 
Richard Riakphore, Matty Harris and Frazer Clarke all return to the ring as well. 
Eubank Jr's big clash against Smith will be shown live on 
. 
The PPV will cost £19.95 to watch. 
You can live stream the action from the Sky Sports Box Office app, which is available for download onto your mobile or tablet device. 
The event is set to get underway from 7pm UK time, with Eubank Jr and Smith expected in the ring around 10.30pm. 
Liam Smith is the smaller man but the more technically gifted. If he can cope with Eubank’s early aggression, he should be able to dominate.
Since linking up with multi-weight legend Roy Jones Jr, Eubank has seemed caught in two contrasting styles.
RJJ insists his star student now has two ways to win; to slug out a victory or to box and move.
But doubters will worry about teaching an old dog new tricks.
