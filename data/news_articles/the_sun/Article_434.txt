A MAN has been arrested for terrorism after being found with a suspected gun and bomb outside a hospital's maternity unit.

Cops arrested a 27-year-old man on suspicion of firearms and explosives offences.
Now he has also been arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, Counter Terrorism Policing North East said.
The suspect was seized by officers  who also found an improvised explosive in a nearby car.
Sources claimed a pressure cooker-style device - similar to the one used in the Manchester Arena terror attack in 2017 - was found in the vehicle. It is unclear if it was viable.
The horror unfolded yesterday morning when patients were evacuated and told to move away from windows.
Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust later confirmed visitors were being blocked from accessing Gledhow Wing.
The unit is where the majority of the maternity ward is held - including the delivery suite - as well as some respiratory and bereavement services.
But the A&E is still open and patients elsewhere in the hospital are being urged to attend appointments as normal unless told otherwise.
Counter Terrorism Policing North East said yesterday: "The 27-year-old man, who has remained in custody since his arrest this morning, has this evening been re-arrested under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000; on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism."
The cordon at the scene has been lifted, but searches continue to be carried out at premises in Leeds.
Detective Chief Superintendent Jim Dunkerley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, said: "This is being treated as an isolated incident and there is no evidence to suggest there is any heightened or ongoing risk to the public.
"Nevertheless, the UK threat level remains at Substantial and we would always encourage the public to be vigilant and to report any suspicious activity or behaviour to police in confidence on 0800 789 321 or at gov.uk/ACT."
