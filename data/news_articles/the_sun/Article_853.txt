DEAR DEIDRE: I AM gay but if I tell my parents I fear they will kick me out.
They are strict Catholics and homophobic. They’ve made it clear they think loving another man is a sin, and anyone who is gay will go to hell.
I’m a 15-year-old boy and feel so miserable and 
.
I don’t want to have to pretend to be someone I’m not for the rest of my life. But the alternative is losing my family.
I can’t talk to anyone about this, least of all my mates.
Every problem gets a personal reply from one of our trained counsellors.

Coming out to prejudiced parents is never easy.
Given time they should learn to accept you are still the same son they love.
You are not alone. There are people who understand what you’re going through, and who can support you and your parents. 
My advice pack, Gay Worries, has links to support organisations.
