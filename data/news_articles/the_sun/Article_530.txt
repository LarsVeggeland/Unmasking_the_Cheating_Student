LEICESTER are continuing their pursuit of Shakhtar Donetsk winger Tete.
The Brazilian’s situation is made a little more complex by the fact he is currently on loan at French club Lyon.
But the Foxes have not given up hope of persuading 
 to do a deal for Tete.
That is despite the Ukrainian side having already 
.
 pulled out of the race for Fiorentina wideman Nico Gonzalez.
That was after the Italian club 
.
An offer of £25m or so could be enough to entice Shakhtar into recalling Tete from France and selling him.
Leicester have been sniffing round the 22-year-old for some time.
When Russia invaded Ukraine last February and football in the country was suspended, there were even suggestions that Tete might have his contract cancelled and leave Shakhtar for nothing.
But he was sent out on a 15-month loan to Lyon.
He has registered six goals and three assists in 17 Ligue 1 appearances.
Leicester are in Premier League action this afternoon at home to Brighton.
They head into the weekend’s fixtures sitting 15th in the top-flight, just two points above the drop zone.
