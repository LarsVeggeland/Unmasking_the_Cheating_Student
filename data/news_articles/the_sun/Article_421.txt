DEAR DEIDRE: ACCIDENTALLY smashing my wife’s favourite vase has brought an abrupt end to our marriage.
I apologised and tried to reconcile, but after 25 years she has started divorce proceedings.
I’m 56 and she’s 53. I can’t get through to her. 
She says the vase was the final straw and she’s had enough of my grumpiness and short fuse.
Admittedly, I have felt low for a long time and haven’t been able to muster any enthusiasm for anything, but I’ve always loved her. 
The last thing I want is a divorce. How do I make her see sense?
