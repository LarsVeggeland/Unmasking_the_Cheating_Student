A TENNIS fan is going to continue playing her sport and wear what she likes despite comments from haters.
Keen player Evie has been told her outfits are not appropriate, but she's not remotely bothered.
Evie showed off her outfit on 
, as well as her clap back at critics.
Traditionally, female tennis players wear short skirts or dresses. 
Some international tennis clubs have strict rules on what should be worn on the tennis court.
But some dress codes are changing in the sport.
Emblazoned across Evie's video is the caption: “A tennis girl can’t wear a tight dress like that.”
Standing on a tennis court, Evie is wearing a figure-hugging pair of sports tights and a tight white top.
The Houston tennis fan’s look is not to everyone’s liking.
But the ball is in her court and she doesn’t care.
In the video her hair is pulled back, she does a spin, racket in hand, and runs to the camera.
She approaches the net and shimmies to the background music, rubbing her forefinger and thumb together as if playing a tiny violin.
The message is clear: People can keep moaning, but she's not listening.
Evie is going to do things her way, and she smiles cheekily into the camera.
Her followers think so too, with over 1,600 liking her post.
