WHEN most people think of country girls, they picture someone in ripped jeans, riding a tractor, getting dirty in the mud.
And while Leah Fish (
) claimed she does indeed love doing “redneck” stuff, she also knows how to rock a little bit of glam.
Leah proved to her TikTok followers that she can get the best of both worlds.
In 
, she showed off her country roots.
“If you got a 
, she’s going to do redneck stuff until she finds other stupid stuff to do,” she said.
Leah walked in a field of nothing but mud and grass, wearing ripped jean shorts, a muscle tee, cowgirl boots, and a backward hat.
Her body was covered in mud, but she looked unbothered as she walked toward a white tractor.
“She’ll get up again to do it more,” she said.
Sitting on an ATV in a T-shirt and shorts, she looked blissful.
In 
, however, she revealed that she knows how to do more than rough it outdoors.
Leah wore her platinum blonde hair in loose waves and she had a full face of makeup on to highlight her beauty.
Her white fitted tank accentuated her boobs and her shiny silver skirt made her look ready for a night out.
She accessorized with an abundance of silver jewelry: necklaces, bracelets, hoops, and rings.
Still, she stuck to what she knew best and topped it off with a cowboy hat.
TikTok viewers fell in love with her transformation.
“Literally drop-dead gorgeous,” one person commented.
“Leah THE FIT IS AMAZING,” added another.
