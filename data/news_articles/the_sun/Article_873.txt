A PLACE in the Sun viewers were left seriously concerned for a house hunter during the property tours. 
Fridays episode saw Lee Juggurnauth in Spain's Costa Blanca with couple Reda and Greg. 
The pair had a budget of £100,000 with a further £10k wiggle room for the right property. 
Lee was also tasked with finding a property with good views, an established garden, outhouse for Greg to work in and room for their in-laws to visit. 
But as they set off on the search, 
 viewers were more distracted by Greg's appearance than the properties they were looking at. 
Having spent some time in the sunshine, Greg's face and particularly his forehead was looking a bit red.
Taking to Twitter, one viewer wrote: "He needs tad of sunscreen on his boat I think!"
Another added: "Greg is going to have sunstroke before we get to property 5."
A third tweeted: "Greg get some factor 50 on. Ouch."
Meanwhile a fourth shared: "His face is disturbingly tomato-like in colour, needs the Factor 50 on #aplaceinthesun."
A fellow viewer joked: "Just switched on, the colour on my tv seems to have reset itself to max red.. but only when i see mateyboy's head!"
After seeing all the properties, the couple decided to have a second viewing of property three and make an offer. 
It was on the market for just over £85k, and they wanted to make a "cheeky offer" of £76k. 
It was rejected but countered with an offer of just under £84k which they accepted.
