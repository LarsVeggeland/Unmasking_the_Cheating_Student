The Gunners were in pole position to sign the 25-year-old 
 at the last minute by old foe and ex-Blues boss Mourinho
 according to Fabrizio Romano.
It seemed like a match made in heaven as 
 rather than move abroad.
But 
 were trying to stall the striker so they could get rid of Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah, Romano claims.
He told the Here We Go podcast, reported by the 
: "They were trying to convince the player and to take his time before joining Roma.
"Because they were looking to sell maybe Lacazette or maybe Eddie Nketiah to have a free slot for a new striker with Tammy Abraham.
“They were really interested, in talks with the agent, but they were prepared to make a proposal. 
"But they were needing to sell a striker before signing Tammy Abraham.
"They were really, really pushing and pushing, they were trying in every possible way."
Arsenal had even tried to derail 
 on loan.
But the deal never materialised and 
 pressed ahead in his pursuit of Abraham, who was the Blues joint-top scorer in 2020-21.
In the end, Abraham couldn't wait any longer and completed his switch to join Mourinho's Roma revolution for £34million.
And Abraham's career at the club got off to a flying start as he provided two assists on his debut, much to the delight of the Roma fans 
.
The striker scored 28 goals in all competitions in his debut season and helped Roma with the inaugural Europa Conference League.
