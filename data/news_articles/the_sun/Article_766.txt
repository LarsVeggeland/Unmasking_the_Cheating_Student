Local Tory MP Scott Benton had slammed the seatbelt investigation as a waste of police time.

A Lancashire Police statement said: "You will be aware that a video has been circulating on social media showing an individual failing to wear a seatbelt while a passenger in a moving car in Lancashire.

A No10 spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister fully accepts this was a mistake and has apologised. He will of course comply with the fixed penalty.”
