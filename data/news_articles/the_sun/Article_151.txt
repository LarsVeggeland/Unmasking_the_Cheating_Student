LOVE Island Unseen Bits is when fans usually get to see all the hilarious bits from the villa which didn't make the cut for the main show.
Normally, the Saturday episode leaves its viewers in stitches, but they've already branded this week's instalment "boring".
There have been a few laughable moments here and there, but fans of the show have hailed one islander a "legend", adding that he is "carrying the show".
The islander in question is none other than farmer Will Young, 23.
Despite having zero luck with love so far, and his attempts being instantly friendzoned, those tuning in have begged producers to ensure he stays as long as possible.
The naturally hilarious islander was a well-known TikTok star prior to his villa entrance, so it's no surprise people find him entertaining.
Viewers instantly took to Twitter to share their thoughts about Unseen Bits so far.
One wrote: "Farmer will in these #unseenbits are killing me.
"Carrying that show."
Another agreed, writing: "I take back whatever I said about Will. 
"I know he’s weird/cringe or whatever you want to call it, but he’s carrying the show."
The comments continued, as one wrote: "Even the 
 
 are boring."
Another fan said: "Why are some of them so dry like it’s 
 
 where’s your personality."
