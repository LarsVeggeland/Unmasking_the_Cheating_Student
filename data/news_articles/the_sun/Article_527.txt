A WOMAN who was dress-coded at work doesn’t understand what was wrong with her attire.
Secretary Anna Romanova thought she had picked a cute outfit for the office one day – but the HR department disagreed.
Posting to TikTok (
), she revealed the look that got her reprimanded earlier that day.
“Guess who got in trouble from HR again for ‘inappropriate work attire,’” she said, admitting that it wasn’t the first time she faced 
.
Her black leather mini skirt was tight enough to show off her small waist and her curves.
She paired it with sheer black tights and stilettos that flattered her legs.
As for her top, it was a bit sexier than the usual work attire.
The silk, teal button-down was left almost entirely open so that you could see her cleavage.
Still, Anna looked proud of her outfit as she confidently strutted and danced in front of the camera.
“I honestly don’t see what’s wrong with it,” she captioned the clip alongside a laughing emoji.
After one TikTok user noted that the outfit would be fine for “casual Friday,” Anna clarified that this was on a regular workday: “Hahaha oh god, this is Monday. You should see my casual Friday.”
Most other users said they loved her look, despite what HR thinks.
“On behalf of the male workforce, thank you and we are willing to club together and pay any fine,” one person wrote.
“Shame on HR. They just feel threatened as you look amazing,” added another.
