The Londoners made several attempts to lure 
 to Stamford Bridge in the 2004-05 season but the midfielder eventually extended his contract with the Reds six weeks after 
 has since reflected on the transfer saga and admitted he regrets toying with the idea of a switch to Stamford Bridge but was very tempted by the offer.
He told 
 on Sky Sports Soccer Box: "I regret the little bit of flirting back then and how that all blew up.
"The fact is I didn’t know whether I was coming or going with 
 at the time. Rafa was having conversations with me like ‘I know your agent is talking to 
 and 
’.
"I got a paranoid feeling at the time that Rafa would have taken money to try and build 
 on.
"Chelsea bid £37.5m. At the time, massive amounts of dough but what would you get for that now?”
Neville joked: “Half a Fred!”
Gerrard continued: "
 was a massive part of that. A lack of maturity on my part allowed me to think about it and flirt with that idea a bit.
"But now I have no regrets at all because Liverpool are the club I love - and that’s the way it should be.”
Gerrard went on to earn legendary status at 
 and never played for any other club in Europe - he only left the Reds to spend 18 months at LA Galaxy before his retirement in 2016.
Chelsea in that time won both European competitions and triumphed in the Premier League five times.
While Gerrard finished his playing career with a Champions League, Uefa Cup, two FA Cups and three League Cups.
