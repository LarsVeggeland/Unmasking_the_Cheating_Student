SKY TV users don't need two controllers thanks to an amazing hack some are only just realising existed.
It turns out the 
 remote can not only be used to adjust the 
's volume.
It has the power to switch your TV set on and off as well.
This means you no longer have to bother with the TV's own remote anymore - aside for those less occasional technical bits.
And best of all, it's really easy to do.
It works on 
 and 
.
Given that 
integrates Sky into a TV set, it should come as no surprise that you can switch off the TV with the Sky remote.
To get your Sky remote to switch your TV on or off, you just need to hold down on the main power button for a couple of seconds longer than usual.
If this doesn't work, it means your TV and Sky aren't paired with HDMI control.
But you can set it up.
On Sky Q, just go to Settings, then Remote Control.
Select Sky Q touch remote and go down to Control your TV.
For Sky Stream, go to Settings, then Connected Devices.
Hit Sky remote, then Control your TV.
Follow the on-screen instructions for pairing the two.
Most modern TVs should work.
Once it's done, you can then control the volume and switch your TV on/off with the Sky remote.
