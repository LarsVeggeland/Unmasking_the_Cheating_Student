The Japan international has impressed on the South Coast this season and has three goals in his last five 
 games.
 | I would very much like to see Mitoma at the carpet next season. He seems to get better every game. Sharp, pacey, incredible work rate. A very Arteta signing. 
 
Like Leandro Trossard, he plays on the left wing and Brighton have not noticed the Belgian's absence in recent games because Mitoma has been in such good form.
Trossard was dropped prior to his 
 after 
.
Mitoma took his place in the side and 
 with an exquisite goal.
The 25-year-old picked up the ball on the left flank and ran at Timothy Castagne before cutting in on his right foot and unleashing a beautiful curling strike into the top-corner.
Fans were in awe of the effort with one saying: "That was world class from Mitoma."
Another added: "Oh My goodness. Sensational. Really great winger, Kaoru Mitoma. What a goal!"
And a third said: "Mitoma is special."
The goal even led some 
 fans to question whether they had signed the wrong Brighton winger, with some predicting he will be worth a lot of money in a few years.
One Gooner wrote: "Trossard is really good but Arsenal should have gone for Mitoma. Two years from now, he will be more than four times the price he is today."
Another added: "Kaoru Mitoma is one hell of a talent. What is a Trossard?"
And a third said: "Not even recency. Trossard is good but when you look at the age and the ability , Mitoma much better option."
