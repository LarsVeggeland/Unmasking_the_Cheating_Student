A COUGAR influencer is living proof that age does not have to be a factor when it comes to desirability.
On her TikTok, 
describes herself with unapologetic chutzpah: “CEO of 
 Watch," she declares.
Her whopping 846k followers and 8.5m likes are bowled over by her “breathtaking” beauty – and confidence.
In her latest video, the age-defying 
 appears beautifully made up, with tumbling blonde hair, wearing a body-hugging black dress with a revealing decolletage.
“In ten years I’ll be 58,” she announces, “with a 13-year-old and a ten-year-old grandchild.
“Hoping they’ll be more grandbabies by then.”
There were over 400 comments to her post, all loving her beauty and amazement that she looks so good for her age.
“Still gorgeous. Hot mama,” said one.
Typical of many was this comment: “Absolutely gorgeous.”
And another impressed viewer added: “Totally stunning.”
Even more: “You are beautiful.”
Amazement: “You strictly define beauty and perfection.”
Age can be a good thing said this comment: “It’s like wine, it gets better with age. You’re living proof of that. Stunning. Whatever you’re doing, don’t stop.”
Finally, it’s not just about looks: “You are a gorgeous natural beauty. Persona and attitude are contributing factors to aging. I will surmise that you must be a positive happy lady.”
