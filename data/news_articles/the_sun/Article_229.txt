CHRIS EUBANK JR wanted to bravely carry on fighting after being brutally put down twice by Liam Smith.  
Smith became the first man to ever send Eubank to the canvas in the middleweight's professional career.  
The fourth-round onslaught continued as 
 was bundled to the canvas as he struggled to keep his footing.  
He once more amazingly made it back to his feet on unsteady legs but the 
Trainer Roy Jones Jr was ready to throw the towel in but Eubank somehow wanted to carry on going.  
He even rushed over to Smith, refusing to believe the bout had ended and had to be held back by opposing coach Joe McNally.  
When Eubank, 33, cleared his head, he congratulated Smith, 34, but insisted he wanted to fight on.  
He said: "Big congratulations to him, I felt like I could have gone on but he caught me with a great shot." 
Eubank followed up the sentiment as he broke his social media silence on Twitter.  
He posted: “Congratulations to Liam tonight, nice lil shot you caught me with there my boy.
“Felt like I could of kept going but referee is in charge & I respect his decision. We’ll get it on again soon.”
Smith becomes the third man to beat Eubank, behind Billy Joe Saunders, 33, and George Groves, 34.
And he could get a second shot back at Anfield 
Eubank said: "If the fans want to see a rematch then we can get it on at Anfield."
Smith teased taking the sequel back home to Merseyside having come up in weight to beat Eubank, 
He said: "If Chris wants the rematch we can do that on my terms.
“I agreed to the rematch clause beforehand so we can see, I can beat all the best fights at 160lbs and 154lbs.”
