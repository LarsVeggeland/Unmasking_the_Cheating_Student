TANTRUMS at the grocery store are usually referred for the toddler set. 
One woman said she causes similar fits whenever she ventures to the shops – but the fuss comes from grown adults.
To explain the phenomenon, Courtney Snell (@courtneysnelll) 
 on a recent outing.
Walking through her local supermarket, Snell wore a tiny white crop top and an even smaller pair of shorts.
She explained in a comment that she had just come from lunch with a friend and was surprised to cause a stir.
"Being scolded in the grocery store for my outfit by the Karens and Bobs," Snell wrote in the caption.
But what her critics wouldn't expect is that Snell has even skimpier outfits waiting for her next shopping day.
"They haven't even seen me grocery shop in my gym fits," she added.
Commenters had a laugh at the trolls' expense, making sure to remind Snell that the critical opinions didn't matter.
"You look amazing," one woman wrote. "If they’re bothered by what someone else is wearing they’re the problem."
"Honey it doesn’t matter if you came from your kid's school," another commenter said. "Do you boo!"
A few viewers could commiserate and shared their own experiences with unwanted fashion feedback.
"Always some old bloke saying 'Aren't you cold in that?'" one wrote.
Another said that she'd been wearing a skort in public, which reached an inch or two above her knee. 
"An old man scolded me for it at a 7-Eleven," she recalled.
But not everyone is so uptight. One fan said their community wouldn't bat an eye at Snell's outfit.
"I live in a beach town," they reassured Snell. "People straight up shop in bikinis."
The stylish shopper was wistful. "My dream," she wrote back.
