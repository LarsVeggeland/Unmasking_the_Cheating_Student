LEEDS UNITED striker Joe Gelhardt will be cleared to speak to interested clubs this week as a queue forms for a loan deal.
Gelhardtâ€™s old club Wigan to make a concrete offer to 
 to pay a part of his wages but several others have expressed an interest and now have to commit.
While Gelhardt is drawn to a sentimental return to Latics, where he was sold to pay bills when they were in administration, there are "bigger" clubs chasing him.
Stoke and Coventry have come in and joined Blackburn Rovers and Swansea who have been asking for him this month.
Gelhardt will only go to a team where he can play and Leeds are looking for a fair chunk of his salary to be paid plus possible bonuses.
Blackburn have looked into Denis Undaz at Brighton as an alternative but insiders reveal they would be the ideal option.
Gelhardt, 20, made 21 appearances for Wigan before leaving for Elland Road in 2020.
He has played 41 times for Leeds, netting twice.
One of his goals game during an epic 3-2 defeat at 
 last season.
While the other was a memorable last minute winner against Norwich.
This season he has started just one Premier League game.
The youngster is a regular off the bench for Jesse Marsch, but hasn't played more than 20 minutes in a Prem match since September 3.
He grabbed an assist in the 5-2 FA Cup victory over Cardiff City this week.
