ANDREW “Freddie” Flintoff has been given as much time as he needs by BBC bosses to decide on his Top Gear future following his horror crash.
They have left the door open after he was “psychologically traumatised”.
Friends of the TV star and former England cricket ace told The Times yesterday he 
 after narrowly avoiding serious physical injury.
, 45, was airlifted to hospital following a horror collision on a test track at the Dunsfold Aerodrome in 
 on December 13.
The dad of four, who ­suffered facial injuries and broken ribs, was reported to have needed surgery. 
His son Corey, 16, said at the time he was “lucky to be alive”.
Following the accident, the 
 suspended filming while footage was examined.
It launched an investigation which is expected to conclude in two weeks.
A formal decision will then be made to restart filming.
But it is understood production may still not resume for several months due to the huge logistics involved in making the show.
And a source yesterday stressed: “Freddie is under no pressure to make a decision.
“The door is very much open for him and will remain so. He can take as much time as he needs.”
His latest accident came three years after he narrowly cheated death in a shock 
.
Spokesmen for both the BBC and Freddie have declined to comment.
