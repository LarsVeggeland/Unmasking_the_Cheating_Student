Romeo Beckham is 
 from Inter Miami's second side.
He made his 
 earlier this month in front of his famous dad and had an eventful time after being 
.
Beckham was in attendance once again to watch Brentford B take on Huddersfield Town B at St. George's Park.
Romeo, 20, played 30 minutes as a second-half substitute in the 
 Cup tie as his parents battled the bitter cold from the stands.
Victoria wrapped up well as she used a scarf to cover her mouth and nose.
Posh looked freezing but she kept her facial expression hidden behind big dark sunglasses and the scarf.
But 
 still clearly felt the cold so 
 draped his coat across her body.
Fortunately the former 
 star was wearing plenty of layers, as he paired a burgundy jumper with a sleeveless dark green jacket and brown cap.
Romeo also featured in Brentford B's 3-2 win over Aston Villa 
.
Beckham 
 after he joined Brentford.
He wrote on Instagram: "Exciting start to the year ❤️. Now the hard work and fun begins.
"Proud of you mate @romeobeckham."
