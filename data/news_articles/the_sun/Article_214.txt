Eubank, 33, made it to his feet on unsteady legs but was again beaten to the deck.  
It left the referee with 
, beating trainer Roy Jones to it.  
Eubank has a rematch clause in his contract should he wish to exercise it and could even do so behind enemy lines.  
He said: "The better man won tonight. He caught me with a great shot.

"If the fans want to see a rematch then we can get it on at Anfield."
Smith becomes the third man to beat Eubank, behind Billy Joe Saunders, 33, and George Groves, 34.
