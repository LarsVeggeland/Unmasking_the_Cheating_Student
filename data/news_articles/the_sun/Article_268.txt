EKIN-SU Culculoglu has publicly called for boyfriend Davide Sanclimenti to "come home".
The Love Island and Dancing on Ice star, 28, shared with her 105K followers on Twitter that she "really misses" her hunky other half.
Davide, 27, is currently visiting pals in Manchester, a place he referred to as his "home away from home" in a recent post.
Ekin-Su is really busy at the moment as she's currently taking part in Dancing on Ice, but it seems like she needs her man with her for support.
She wrote on Twitter: "I really miss my man so much.
"Hurry an come home pls".
The “nude” body stocking was embellished with tiny mirrors to protect her modesty — but it was too little for some.
Telly watchdog 
 received 112 complaints about the wardrobe choice.
The 
 winner defended her skimpy outfits.
She raged: “You know what? If you have ’em flaunt them.
“I mean if you’ve got a nice bum and you look sexy in a unitard, why not. Who cares?”
But the outfit was not enough to save her from the skate off after she got the fewest public votes for her debut with pro partner Brendyn Hatfield, 37.
