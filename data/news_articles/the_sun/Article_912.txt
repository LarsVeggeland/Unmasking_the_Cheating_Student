A FIRST TIME mum has told how she receives a lot of hate for sharing how quickly her body has bounced back after pregnancy.
The 21-year-old, who posts to 
under the username @saylorseifert, shared a video where she can be seen wearing a crop top and high-waisted leggings as she holds her newborn. 
She then explains: "Your body bouncing back right after having a baby is real - don't let social media fool you."
Alongside the video, she added: "I know everyone’s experience is different but bouncing back after pregnancy gets so much hate even though it is real and there’s nothing wrong with it."
The video has since racked up over 66,000 views - and it wasn't long before social media users took to the comments section.
"Who said this doesn't happen lol everybody's body is different! But it's OKAY if yours doesn't right away," wrote one.
The young mum replied: "I agree! Some people don’t like to acknowledge it and like to hate on mums who do bounce back. 
"All mums should be proud of their body no matter what."
A second pointed out: "You’re also 21 which does help with the bouncing back aspect. 
"You really do look fabulous though!"
A third noted: "Girl, too many ppl told me I’d bounce back and I in fact did not…
Meanwhile, a fourth commented: "I feel like people def know this but just share more about the changes that happens after because that’s most common!"
Another urged: "It’s okay to be happy about it!!"
A further added: "I had kids at 20, 24, and 27 and bounced back all three times. 
"I think genetics has a big part to play."
