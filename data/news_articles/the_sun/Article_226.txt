DANCING On Ice has been hit by over a hundred complaints from furious viewers after Ekin-Su skated in a sexy launch night outfit
The Love Island winner dazzled on the ice in a silver and nude jumpsuit on Sunday night - but it was too much for some.
The broadcasting watchdog received 112 complaints about the daring wardrobe choice.
The item was designed to be a replica of Britney Spears' outfit from her Toxic music video, which Ekin danced to, and it consisted of full fabric with no flesh showing.
The 28-year-old looked incredible in the 
, which showed off her toned figure.
But some 
 to be worn before the watershed.
One said: @EN52871824 said: "That's not the worst thing about her act, the outfit and dance moves completely inappropriate for a family programme....if its going to seedy and disgusting then put it on after 9....."
Another added: "Totally inappropriate outfit. Its a family show".
Someone else said: "That's a post-watershed outfit."
"Bit much for a family show," added another.
One wrote: ‚ÄúThought she was going to start stripping! Family show!!!‚Äù
A second said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm no prude but i was panicking we were going to see what she had for breakfast there with that outfit ü§£ü§£‚Äù
Ekin-Su was defended by others who rubbished the claims. 
One said: "What did you want her to wear? A Sunday dress?."
Another added: "All the prudes on the phone to ofcom after Ekin su crawled on the floor in a leotard."
Ekin was left disappointed as she received the fewest public votes for her first performance with professional partner Brendyn Hatfield, despite scoring a respectable 21.5 points.
She will now compete against next week's weakest skater in the bottom two.
