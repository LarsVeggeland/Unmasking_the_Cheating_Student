GOT your oven preheated for your Sunday roast? Well you might want to read this before you start cooking.
A home cook has revealed how he cooked his entire roast dinner in the Air Fryer, saving money on his bills in the process.
TikTok user 
 shared his trick for getting the perfect roast beef dinner with his followers.
Speaking in the video, he said: “I’ve got a beautiful bit of beef topside (and) I’m going to try something totally different today, I’ve never done this before.
“I’m going to try and cook a whole roast dinner in the Air Fryer.”
As well as the beef, the dad planned to cook potatoes, Yorkshire puddings and roasted vegetables without any use of the oven.
He began by seasoning his beef with salt and pepper and popping it into his TowerAir Fryer at 200 degrees, using a thermometer to check when it reached 55 degrees internally.
He then let it rest before slicing to reveal beautifully pink and tender beef.
“I tell you what it cooked it perfectly,” the dad says, “And in a much quicker time as well.”
The dad then shared a video of his delicious crispy parmentier potatoes and roasted vegetable that had been parboiled before making their way into the fryer.
Viewers were left drooling over the video with many keen to try out the cooking method for themselves.
“Looks unreal mate,” commented one, with another adding, “That’s bang on.”
A third wrote, “OMG, That looks gorgeous 😍….could eat that now.”
“Pls let me move in 😂” joked another.
