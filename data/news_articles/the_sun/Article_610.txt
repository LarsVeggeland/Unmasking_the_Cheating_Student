But according to the 
, scans show that there is no serious damage to Guimaraes' ankle.
The report goes on to state that Guimaraes has declared himself fit for Saturday’s game at Selhurst Park.
Boss Eddie Howe said in his pre-match press conference: "He was devastated to come off the pitch. I probably think he thought at the time he had serious damage to his ankle. 
"The scan did come back with positive news and hopefully it's not a long-term injury.
"We're still not sure when he's going to be back but he's made good progress this week. 
"We'll have a constant eye on the situation."
Newcastle are light in the midfield department. 
Jonjo Shelvey,

A number of transfer targets have been spoken about, including Wolves' Ruben Neves, Manchester United’s Scott McTominay and Chelsea pair Conor Gallagher and Ruben Loftus-Cheek.
However, it is unlikely that Prem clubs will do business with Newcastle this month. 
Borussia Monchengladbach’s rising star, Kouadio Kone, is also being watched.
