"Ultimately, it’s for every sovereign government to decide how they are best able to support the Ukrainians as a member of Nato.
"The Ramstein process is about co-ordinating our respective support. The Ukrainians said that they need and want tanks, and they need Western calibre Nato standard tanks. We provided some Challenger 2s.
"Countries across Nato have provided a range of armoured vehicles. Some of that includes light tanks and some of that includes significant artillery.
"We will continue working with our friends and allies across Nato to make sure that the support we give to the Ukrainian armed forces and Ukrainian people are the most effective at helping them defend themselves against this brutal invasion."

Andriy Melnyk, Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister, shared his frustration over Germany for taking its time to decide whether tanks will be sent over or not.
He told CNN: "The government in Germany has not taken this important decision, not just to first allow other nations like Poland, Finland or Spain or Greece, which do have German battle tanks, to do the same, but also strengthen and create this, as we call it 'Global Tanks Coalition' to help Ukrainian forces to push out the Russians and to start the counteroffensive which will allow us to liberate the occupied territories.

"After 331 days of brutal war which Russia has been waging against Ukraine, they are still making an inventory of stocks, of (the) Bundeswehr (the armed forces of the Federal Republic of Germany) and in the industry, to check whether they have something to send to Ukraine! It is ridiculous."
