JESY Nelson let her body to the talking as she was photographed on a night out with a pal in a very risque nude dress.
The 
 looked great in the full length frock with its naked woman design matching up with Jesy's own figure.
The pop star wore black boots and a leather jacket with the raunchy item and finished her look with shades.
She strutted out of fancy Japanese restaurant Aqua Kyoto in London holding hands with her friend, before climbing into rapper boyfriend Zion Foster's car outside that was waiting outside.
The couple have been inseparable as of late, with J
 of them hanging out together at her house.
A recent clip saw them messing around with a tattoo Instagram filters as they laughed in her kitchen.
And today Jesy revealed a small, real Yin and Yang tattoo tribute to her new man on her arm.
The pair high-fived and then shared a kiss to mark the tribute.
It comes just days after Jesy revealed another new
to Little Mix fans - with a very special and personal meaning. 
The singer, who left the girl band in 2020 to focus on a solo music career, took to Instagram to reveal the new inking. 
The star posted a video of her getting the tattoo to her Instagram fans, as she lay face down on the bed. 
The Boyz singer posed in a tiny crop top as she was inked with the words: "I am good enough!"
She told fans: "I wanted to get this tattoo to show my fans how much they mean to me. 
"They have supported me through everything and stood by me, I honestly wouldn’t be where I am today without them!"
"I love you all so much. Thank you for creating this beautiful tattoo for me," she concluded.
