DRIVERS are blown away by a £15 product that makes 20-year-old headlights look brand new.
A woman posted the trick on a 
group and transformed her old yellowing headlights in five minutes.
The woman uses a budget product called Armorall Headlight Restorer Wipes, which cost £15 in the UK.
She wrote on Facebook: "Something a little different but still so satisfying! 
We have teamed up with 7days Performance to offer you a special discounted chance to win the amazing cars this week.
Using the code SUN10, you will get 10p off the normal price of 99p.
"I restored the heavily oxidised and yellowed headlights on my Toyota.
"Took me all of five minutes and will last for up to six months."
The woman said that the product comes with two wipes.
One to detoxify the headlight and another one to prevent UV rays from causing yellowing again.
She said: "You just wipe on the outside and dry with a paper towel.
"Then wipe again with a second wipe that seals/protects.”
The motorist said she only had to clean the outside of the headlights.
She ended her post by saying: "Hopefully, it works for a few months with my car sitting in the searing sun 24/7."
Most Facebook users were blown away by this hack.
One said: "OMG, how! Looks amazing!"
Another said: "'I must say that I’m very impressed. 
"I have been in the panel beating and spray painting trade for over 36 years and many times have had to sometimes remove headlights and clean them up, on average to get them as clean as possible, it could be an hour or more."
A third pointed out: "I’ve tried £56 kits from car accessories stores without success, but these literally wiped away the cloudiness in seconds."
