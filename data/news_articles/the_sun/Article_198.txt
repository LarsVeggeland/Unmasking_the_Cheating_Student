IF you have a big boobs - you'll already know how tricky it can be to find the perfect bikini. 
Often they're too small, not supportive enough or the bottoms are so big they're hanging down by your knees. 
One person who understands this is fashion fan Haley who goes by 
online. 
Keen to find the perfect bikini, Haley shared a swimsuit shopping haul from Shien with her 71K TikTok followers. 
She said: “Shein haul for my big titty girls lets see what works and what doesn’t work.”
The first Haley tried on was too small.
She said: “Okay first one first, super cute but a little busty. I got a medium, probably could have got it a little bigger but still cute.”
Haley could barely fit into the second swimsuit. 
She said: “Okay this one is super cute. It's not bad. It's got a little bit of coverage.”
The last swimsuit was also too small. 
She said: “Last one is still kinda cute, still super busty. I think if you’re over a DD cup you probably should not try Shein or the plus size Shein. I don't know.” 
But it looks like Haley decided she would be sending all the swimsuits back to Shein.
She concluded: “Def[initely] will be returning.”
Haley’s video gained over 62,000 views. 
Although it was clear Haley had made her video for girls her comments section was flooded with comments from men.
Many commenters requested Hailey do more hauls.
One commenter said: “This is literally helpful tbr.”
A second said: “Medium is perfect.”
A third commenter said: “To be perfectly honest I have no idea what the colour of anything in this video was.”
Another commenter said: “You should do these for fitness and dresses also.”
