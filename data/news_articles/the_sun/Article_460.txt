CHELSEA are interested in signing Lyon wonderkid Malo Gusto, according to reports.
The Blues have 
 nearly £200million on young talent this month, as 
 looks to back 
.
And their winter splurge doesn't look like ending any time soon.
According to French newspaper 
, 
 want to sign 19-year-old right-back Gusto this month.
The teenager has already made over 50 appearances for Lyon and has been a regular this season.
His performances have earned him seven France under-21 caps and a reputation for being one of the world's best young full-backs.
He has 18 months remaining on his Lyon contract.
But the Ligue 1 side want to keep him until the end of the season.
Lyon have underachieved this season, sitting ninth in the French top flight and 12 points off the European spots.
Should he get to move this month, Gusto could offer valuable cover for crocked star Reece James.
The 
 international has been sidelined by knee injuries this term.
Chelsea have spent £186.5m in the last three weeks, on David Datro Fofana, Andrey Santos, Benoit Badiashile, Mykhailo Mudryk and Noni Madueke.
They also paid a £10m loan fee to borrow Joao Felix from Atletico Madrid until the end of the season.
Despite their spending, the Blues sit 10th in the Prem table.
They drew 
 earlier, and remain nine points off 
 in fourth, with the Toon possessing a game in hand.
