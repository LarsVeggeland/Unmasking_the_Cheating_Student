THE number of men who snap their todger during sex is swelling, official NHS figures show.
Surgeons repaired 169 fractured manhoods in the 12 months to last April — up 46 on the year before.
Experts reckon it may show that more men are using 
 to make a stand. 
Most procedures involve men in their 30s, although two in their 70s had breaks last year. 
The repair involves cutting into the penis to stitch the tear.
-based consultant 
 Gordon Muir said breaks occur during 
 when the willy comes out and gets bent on the way back in — usually when the woman is on top.
He said: “Most men feel a pop or crack and lose their erection.
“There’s usually bruising. The penis can look like an aubergine. 
“If untreated, 
 or scarring can cause serious long-term problems.”
Rob Andrews, 32, of 
, snapped his member during a Viagra-fuelled romp with partner Isabella Woolf. 
She said: “I jumped on top of him and heard a crack.
“At the hospital, X-rays confirmed a penis break. Fortunately it’s recovered!”
