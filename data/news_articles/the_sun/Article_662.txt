The video title reads: 'Easier than I thought.'
He says in the video: "It was put on by our neighbour, who doesn't want us parking in front of her house. It's a public street.
"So I'm putting a Phillips head and a flathead screwdriver in the same hole. Look at that. Watch this loosen up.
"Oh, it's not there yet. It just takes a giant Phillips head and a regular flathead to get this out."
At the end of the video, the man manages to remove the clamp.
Most users think that what the neighbour did wasn't right.
One said: "On my street, you can only park on one side of the street, my side. 
"So why would I be mad if someone parked in front of my house unless they’re blocking my driveway?"
Another user said: "People seem to have a hard time understanding that parking on the street is public parking.
"You don't need permission to park in front of someone's house as long as the driveway is not blocked."
A third pointed out: "If they don't want you to park in front of their house, why would they put something on your car that keeps it in front of their house?"
