IT'S the end of a long week, and few of us will have the energy to start mixing things up in the bedroom.
But while missionary is an old reliable it can become a bit stale however, there are plenty of low effort variations to add a little pizzaz to your partnership.
One such variation is the tried and tested Throwback Thursday position.
It’s ideal if you fancy a low-energy session that will leave you immensely satisfied.
In fact, it's so enjoyable you won't want to limit it to Thursdays. 
This variation of the 
 sex position involves lying on your back with your legs spread and knees bent.
As your partner slots in between, the only bit of work you have to do is lifting your hips high enough for them to penetrate.
The great thing about this position is that your partner can either by kneeling down or standing up - which makes it ideal for spicing things up around the house.
Depending on whether or not you're feeling up to it, the Throwback Thursday also allows 
 to set the pace based on the angle of your legs - which means very little work for a very big reward.
And to really amp things up, a tingling peppermint lube is a sure fire way to ensure your bodies slot together in perfect harmony.
Plus not only does this position treat your partner to some intense angles, it also frees their hands up for some added pleasure.
Why not take the passion to the steamy new level by adding a vibrator into the mix?
Or even coax your partner into wearing a vibrating cock ring. 
Not only can this enhance is performance and even boost the size and strength of his erection. 
But the vibrations from the ring can intensify pleasure the receiver feels.
