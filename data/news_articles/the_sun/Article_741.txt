Alex Reid and his fiancée Nikki Manashe have announced they are expecting twins.
and his wife to be have shared the happy news about their impending double delivery.
They told 
 that they are expecting non-identical twins and Nikki is 13 weeks along.
It comes after the pair
 in 2021 after a seven year IVF battle.
Blogger Nikki told the publication: "It's crazy a woman, who was told "you probably won't be able to have children", and has had fertility struggles is now going to be a mum-of-three.
"We were just absolutely shocked to be honest. I know people will say "well how can you be shocked because you had embryos put in?" but Anastasia was a twin as well and we lost her twin really early on in pregnancy. "
She added: "It's still early days, everything is going so perfectly. Both of them healthy, their growing how they should be. We're super, super excited and we're going to have a crazy busy household."
Nikki has had quite the journey to motherhood. 
She almost died after an eptopic pregnancy before the couple embarked on IVF.
Six pregnancies then tragically ended in miscarriage for the pair before their 'miracle' baby Anastasia arrived.
"I had the most horrific PTSD. I didn't leave the house at some points.  It's in my bones to be a mum," Nikki revealed.
When Anastasia was born, Alex shared on social media: 
said: "Just so in love. My beautiful daughter and mama are safe at home! What a crazy week we have been on!!!
"I am one lucky man with such an incredible family."
