THINKING about getting a dog? You might want to read this first.
In a new 
 thread, vets have revealed the breeds of dogs that they would never get themselves, and you will definitely recognise a few.
Taking to the forum, a redditor asked fellow users what dog breed they would avoid and a professional vet was quick to weigh in.
Commenting on the thread, they wrote: “Lots of breeds I personally wouldn’t own… any brachycephalic breeds like Pugs, French Bulldogs, British Bulldogs, King Charles Cavaliers… bred for how they look when they’re predisposed to SO many illnesses.”
The medic then went on to explain the type of illnesses that are typical of those breeds, and they are enough to put you off, no matter how cute the breed.
They added: “I’ve seen so many of these dogs die under the age of 5 due to the issues they’re predisposed to. 
“Epilepsy, eye problems, skin problems, neurological disorders (to name a few). I just also wouldn’t want to contribute to the suffering of these animals by buying one. 
“Not being able to breathe is not “normal” for the breed.”
The vet went on to list a further few breeds that they are used to seeing in the surgery.
“West Highland terriers, Weimaraner, Dalmatian’s, Dachsunds, Yorkies… again to name a few,” they wrote.
“When you work as a vet tech it puts you off so many breeds.”
Fellow animal lovers were quick to weigh in themselves.
