VINTAGE Star Wars toys discovered at the back of a cupboard are to be sold at auction for an eye-watering £600,000.
The over 
 - including Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader - are still in their original packaging.
Dating from the late 1970s and early 80s, the 
 for 40 years by a pensioner.
He had the bright idea to buy multiple versions of the same figures, gifting some to his kids but 
.
Now aged in his 70s, the anonymous 
 nut has decided to flog the toys, all from manufacturers Kenner, at auction.
Among the Inter-Galactic treasure trove are five ultra-rare 'double-telescopic' 
 that have an extendable Lightsabre which can be pulled out his arm.
One figure alone can fetch over £12,000 at auction.
Another box dating back to 1978 has 24 unopened Yoda figures, that stash alone has an estimate of £15,000.
And there are eight Boba Fett figures worth £6,000 apiece in the vendor's, from Illinois, USA, collection.
Models of stubby robot RT-D2, his pal C-3PO, Princess Leah, Han Solo and Stormtroopers also make up the epic job lot.
Given the number of unopened boxes, and some which never made it to the shelves, experts reckon the vendor had a contact at the manufacturers.
Chuck Lang, a Star Wars toy expert at Morphy Auctions, who are selling the lot, said the "incredible" stash has created "a lot of buzz" among collectors.
The toys go on sale in Pennsylvania between February 1-3.
