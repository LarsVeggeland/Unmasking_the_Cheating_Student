LIAM SMITH has set his sights on Kell Brook and Gennady Golovkin Jr after sensationally knocking out Chris Eubank Jr. 
 was dropped for the first time in his professional career after a barrage of shots in round four sent him to the canvas.   
And Smith, 34, bundled him down again which forced referee Victor Loughlin 
Eubank, 33, 
, guaranteeing him a sequel if he wants it.  
But following the news Brook, 36, 
, Smith has another blockbuster British option.  
And he could even inherit a potential middleweight title shot from Eubank against WBA and IBF champion Golovkin, 40.  
Smith said: "I'm open to anything, I always have been. You can ask anyone who's ever dealt with me over the years, I'm not hard to deal with.  
"But if it's Chris next it's Chris next, if not I'll sit down and I've got very good options.  
"Ben [Shalom] said Kell wants to fight the winner, that's a huge fight. I know there's talks of Golovkin.  
"So I'm in a good position now at 160 as well as 154, so a win today was all that matters."  
Brook retired last year after finally getting a winning shot at long-time rival Amir Khan, 36.  
Meanwhile Golovkin is still champion at middleweight but last September lost his super-middleweight trilogy bout to Canelo Alvarez, 32.  
Smith's own future may not be in his own hands, depending on what Eubank 
But the former light-middleweight champ insisted, having come up a division, he calls the shots on any rerun.  
He said: "If Chris wants the rematch we can do that on my terms.
“I agreed to the rematch clause beforehand so we can see, I can beat all the best fights at 160lbs and 154lbs.”
