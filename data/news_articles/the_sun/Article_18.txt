CRISTIANO RONALDO is all set to make his official debut in Saudi top-flight football - and a win could fire Al Nassr to the top of the table TODAY.
Ronaldo, 37, has already had a run-out in a mouth-watering midweek friendly with 
 
Al Nassr are revelling in the attention of Ronaldo's imminent debut.

Everything in place üíõ 
It may be his official debut - but of course Ronaldo had the fanfare of a two-goal, man-of-the-match display when the Riyadh All-Stars XI¬†lost 5-4 to PSG just three days ago.
Ron looked baffled to win the individual gong - after a thriller where big rival Lionel Messi put the French giants in front after just three minutes.
But it will be less of a shock if he's the star performer this afternoon as his new team Al Nassr are strong favourites against Ettifaq.
Cristiano Ronaldo's Al Nassr take on Ettifaq¬† at 5.30 UK time - 8.30pm in Saudi Arabia.
Venue Mrsool Park holds around 25,000 fans.
The two sides last met in a 2-2 draw in March 2022.
We are less than 90 minutes away from the debut Cristiano Ronaldo hinted would never happen...  
The five-time Ballon d'Or winner, 37, said he had no intentions of winding down his career away from the big leagues.
But here he is this afternoon aiming to fire new club Al Nassr to the top of the Saudi Por League - with victory over mid-table Ettifaq.
