A TAKEAWAY dubbed one of the cheapest in the UK serves 12inch pizzas for just £6.60.
Ali's Chippery & Curry House in Preston, 
, offers the cheesy treat for a fraction of the national average of £9.15. 
Despite being a bargain, the 
 joint apparently doesn't compromise on flavour. 
Customers love the "first class" curries and "properly-made" pizza bases, according to online reviews. 
Fatima Aziz ordered a 12in pepperoni from the "simplistic" chippy this week and loved it. 
She told 
: "I'm of the opinion that when you order a pepperoni pizza, you don't need anything fancy. 
"And cheap and cheerful is exactly what I'd describe this pizza from Ali's takeaway as.
"It was soft and super cheesy.
"Not the thickest of bases but each slice had just enough pepperoni to get that distinct smoky flavour in each bite."
Ali's has a Google rating of 3.8 stars out of five, with many people praising its diverse menu - which includes kebabs, curries, pizzas, pasta dishes, garlic bread, pies, fish and chips, burgers, fried chicken and Persian cuisine. 
On Just Eat, it scores five out of six, while it gets 4.3 out of five on Uber Eats. 
Charles, who ordered through Just Eat on January 19, said: "Good value for decent, if not excellent, food."
In December, Geoff wrote: "Absolutely bang on. Pies absolutely perfect and chips faultless.
"Take a bow."
Preston, where Ali's is located, ranked number three in Just Eat's list of the UK towns and cities with the best value takeaways.
Here, the average take-out meal costs £6.25. 
In second place was Kingston Upon Hull (£6.17), while
