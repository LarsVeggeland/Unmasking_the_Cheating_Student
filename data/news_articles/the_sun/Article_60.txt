A HUGE blast ripped through a terraced house in the early hours of this morning, residents say.
Terrified locals were forced to flee the normally quiet street in Goole, East 
, following the "explosion".
Many found safety in a nearby parish church, where they huddled among the pews.
One described it as "like a scene from the Blitz" as 999 workers moved to clear the wreckage.  
An East Yorkshire Ambulance Service spokesperson confirmed no one was injured.
But families were ordered to leave their homes as police, firefighters and gas workers sealed off the area in Marlborough Avenue. 
Neighbours claim the devastation was caused by a massive blast which ripped through the house overnight. 
Shocking photos from the scene show a gaping hole in the side of the property and a collapsed roof.
The whole upper floor appears to have been blown out, leaving just a burnt shell. 
And the downstairs windows look to be missing, with rubble piled up by the front door. 
Lidija Jeremejeva, who was told he had to his home, said: "I live across the street from the building.
"Everyone is gone except the workers who cleaned the ruins and the police control blocking half of the street from the roundabout to the middle of the street."
