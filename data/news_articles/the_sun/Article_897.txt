CHELSEA have some interesting options to spring on Liverpool ahead of their huge clash at Anfield tomorrow.

Alternatively, Potter could opt for a back three which he has often done as Blues boss.
In this scenario, Azpilicueta could be recruited to join the defence with Trevoh Chalobah pushed to right-wing back for his speed. 
While Mudryk could have to tuck in as he joins a front three of Mount and Havertz.
