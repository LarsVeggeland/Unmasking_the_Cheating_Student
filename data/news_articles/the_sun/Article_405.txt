ONE female cop made single men want to be cuffed by her. 
Police woman Rose showed viewers her in and out-of-uniform looks and they were blown away. 
Rose posted a 
 on her account (
) to reveal her two looks that made people want to confess. 
She started suited up in her patrol car. 
The brave law enforcement worker had her hair in a ponytail and wore a bulky bullet proof vest. 
Attached to her shoulders were a handheld flashlight, badge, and radio. 
Rose was dressed and ready for her shift. 
"When they ask what you look like out of uniform," she said. 
The confident worker pursed her lips before she flashed a sly smile. 
Suddenly, Rose switched styles and vehicles. 
She was in a red car with her hair down and curled. 
Instead of the thick uniform, Rose was in a tight black low-cut dress. 
Another shot showed her in a form-fitting zip-up that exposed her cleavage line. 
Rose captioned the video with a single "kissy face" emoji. 
A forward TikTok user commented: "She got me thinking I could date a cop." 
One interested male expressed their awe. 
"Absolutely breathtaking in and out of uniform," they wrote. 
"Pretty either way," one kind man said. 
Desperate viewers attempted to attract Rose with guilty confessions. 
"I committed a crime. Arrest me," a man admitted. 
"Aye, I was doing 55 in a 20," a commenter wrote.
