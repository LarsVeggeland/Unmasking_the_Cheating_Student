SOME say if you find a job you love, you never have to work a day in your life.
One 19-year-old woman named Thea Uglum said she found her dream job, but others put her down for it.
Thea works at an oil rig in Norway, and her shifts are often 12 hours a day.
Although it is a male-dominated industry, she loves the job and often shares glimpses into her job through her TikTok, where she goes by 
.
In one video, she shared a comment that she gets from people: “Independent women in male jobs are unattractive.”
To shut down the haters and change their minds, she showed them the kinds of views she gets to look at every day thanks to her position.
And they all were extremely cool.
The first one showed what her oil site, which is right over the ocean, looked like at night. 
Lit up and with the construction vehicles around it in motion, it looked enchanting.
Thea also showed how stunning it looked at sunrise and sunset.
The next view she revealed was from a helipad, with the helicopter parked inside a garage.
Thea looked happy and proud as she posed in her navy blue and neon yellow uniform.
“This is the part of me that you’re never gonna ever take away from me,” she wrote.
TikTok viewers were mesmerized by the scenes and told her to ignore those who criticize her.
“That’s the opinion of very few, who are usually threatened by women doing as good, or better, jobs than them!” one person wrote.
“I wish I could come for the view,” added another.
