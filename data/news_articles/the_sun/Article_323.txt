SAINSBURY’S has been mocked for telling customers how to cut a cake in “nanny state-style” warnings on packaging.
Many of the
’s own brand bakes come with detailed instructions telling the buyer what surface and knife is required to produce the perfect slice.
They even remind eaters to get rid of the packaging before tucking in to the sweet treat.
The label of one of its iced fruit cakes reads: “How to cut: Remove outer and inner packaging before cutting.
“Place cake, still on its board, on a flat surface.
“Hold the cake and with a long, clean, serrated, sharp knife, cut the cake in to slices using a sawing action. 
"Clean the blade between each cut.”
One customer complained on 
: “The nanny state is getting ridiculous now. 
"Are the public considered so thick they don’t know how a slice a cake?”
But some were baffled by the need to clean the knife between each slice. 
Sainsbury’s explained: “It’s a standard tip for cakes that need slicing.”
Other cakes with instructions on how to cut include Sainsbury’s Madeira cake and all its Taste the Difference range.
