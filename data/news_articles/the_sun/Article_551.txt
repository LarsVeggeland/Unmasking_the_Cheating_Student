FULHAM have a surprise name on their shortlist of midfield targets - Preston North End dynamo Ben Whiteman.
The former 
 trainee, 26, has caught the eye since joining 
 from Doncaster in January 2021.
 boss 
 is looking to strengthen his side's midfield options this month.
The Cottagers have enjoyed an impressive first half of the season back in the 
 after last season’s promotion.
They went into the weekend’s fixtures sitting sixth in the top-flight, just two points behind Tottenham.
Now Silva wants to build on that.
The Cottagers have been linked with a move for Everton midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure.
However, at about £5m, Whiteman would be a cheaper alternative.
Whiteman is in the final 18 months of his contract at Preston.
And Fulham know that he would understandably jump at the chance of a move to the Premier League.
Whiteman has played 26 times for the Deepdale outfit so far this term and scored twice.
That follows on from his four goals in 48 appearances last season.
