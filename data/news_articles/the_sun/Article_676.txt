 (@frankietavares) is a digital content creator whose productions focus on outfit inspiration.
She took to TikTok to share her latest take — styling a 
 piece from Amazon.
"Styling inspo," she wrote. "The Amazon coverup."
First, Tavares made sure that all elements of her look were in line with the piece.
"Let's change this hair," she said, showing up with a glamorous up-do.
She wore denim and a nude-colored seamless bra with the coverup on top.
She dazzled in the shimmery number and the contrast between the coverup and denim balanced the look.
She topped off the viral style with a long white faux fur coat, which elongated her silhouette.
"It’s 
 for a reason," she added in the caption.
The piece is called the Honganda Sexy Women's Sheer Mesh Pearl Rhinestone 
, which retails for $25 from Amazon.
The 
 beauty revealed that she purchased the coverup in a size large.
Fans of the look shared their two cents in the comment section of the video.
"You look stunning," one wrote.
"Love this," another added.
