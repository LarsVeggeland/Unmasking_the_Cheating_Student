Before announcing her pregnancy, Stacey said she had gone through a crisis about being childless at 35 after filming for a documentary.
She was forced to dig deep during her 10-day stay with the Sisters of St Hilda’s Priory Order of the Holy Paraclete in Whitby, North Yorkshire for her new show. 
She told The Sun how the experience - which saw her living alongside the nuns - made her prioritise her life at home with Kevin. 
In a scene from the show, Stacey said: "For the last 15 years it's been work, work, career, work, work and then your private life is on the back burner. I'm 35 so…”
When a nun asked her if she "wanted a family", she concluded: "I know. I need to start thinking about it, don’t I?”
