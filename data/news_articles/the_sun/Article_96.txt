A FLIGHT attendant has lifted the lid on the best seat on the plane to avoid turbulence.
Sarah Goodwin, who works for Virgin Australia, shared a handful of tips to nervous flyers on her

The Perth native also warned any jittery travellers not to drink any caffeine, as coffee and other beverages can heighten your 
 - resulting in niggling headaches and insomnia.
Instead, Goodwin swears by a less is more approach, advocating for 
 such as unsalted nuts, fruit and umami-flavoured snacks. 
When booking your seat, the flight attendant claims there is one spot in particular every passenger should lock down to minimize

In a now-deleted video, Goodwin advised: "When booking your seat, try and book a seat as close to the front of the aircraft as you can, because that is where you experience the least amount of turbulence."

She warned: "Talk to a flight attendant, we rarely, rarely drink the tea or coffee.
"They (beverages) come from the same water tank and so when you're drinking that coffee and tea it comes from that hot water and it's absolutely disgusting.
"The parts in the coffee machine won't be cleaned unless they are broken and the whole machine is never cleaned and they're by the lavatories."
