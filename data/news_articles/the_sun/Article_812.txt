KERRY Katona said she is "f****** p***** off with her body" after putting on 3st and said she will postpone her wedding until she loses weight. 
The former Atomic Kitten star, 42, admitted that she feels "out of shape" at 12 and a half stone. 
Sharing a video from her incredible home gym, 
 said she is desperate to shed the pounds and won't walk down the aisle at her current size.
"As you all know, I've put 3st on, I quit smoking and I put it down to that," she told fans.
"This is not my body, my legs are really badly swollen and I'm just not in the greatest of shapes."
She continued: "I am so f****** p***** off with the way my body is.
"I had surgery the year before and I messed it up, I'm like a flatpack from IKEA, I come in a cardboard box and you've got instructions how to put me together as I've been sliced and diced that much. 
"The only way I can take any kind of control of this, is me...I have to do this. I've got to do this. 
"You have to get uncomfortable to get comfortable and it's really f****** hard and I need accountability."
The singer lifted up her black t-shirt to reveal her stomach and joked that she was "tripping over her body parts" as they've become so "saggy". 
 "I know I'm not obese but this is not my body, there is no filter," the media personality said.
"I blame quitting smoking, which has been three years. But I've got to start training, I'm 43 this year. 
"Once you turn 40 everything drops, its like health and safety in my house, I'm tripping over all my body parts."
Kerry was then asked by a fan if she was going to tie the knot with her fiancé Ryan Mahoney this year, to which Kerry replied: "No, I'm definitely not walking down the aisle looking like this, I'm in no rush to get married just yet. 
"I will marry Ryan one day but when I don't know. 
"I love Ryan with all my heart and I will be with him till the day I die."
Alongside the honest post, Kerry penned: "Can’t get more real than this!! This is it folks no filters no airbrushing I’ve put three stone on. 
"I am 5 foot two and fart and I am 12 1/2 stone so when you little like me you can’t carry as well. 
"I quit smoking three years ago which didn’t help with weight gain and city complaining, moaning and being depressed about it only I can do this only I can change this, but I am asking for all of your help and support and accountability and to encourage me and to keep me going."
Kerry's fans raced to share their messages of support to help her on her weight loss journey.
One wrote: "You always make me smile Kerry!!! I love your honesty, never change."
Another posted: "You look amazing never put yourself down." 
"You've got this Kerry, you've done it before and succeeded," a third added.
