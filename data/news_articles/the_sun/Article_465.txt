Read on for our tips and back a horse by clicking their odds.
He went down in a head-bobber at Fairyhouse before another good effort at Leopardstown last time. He can make the frame again.
He wasn’t beaten far here last time out in September and has had a little nudge down the weights.
He returns to the Flat after hurdling and was a good winner at Thirsk in the summer. He’ll stay this trip well.
