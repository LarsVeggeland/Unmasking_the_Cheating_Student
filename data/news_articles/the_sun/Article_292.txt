WOKE museum chiefs have stopped referring to embalmed ancient Egyptian dead as mummies.
Chiefs at the British Museum in 
 say it is dehumanising to the person’s memory.
They are now called “mummified person” or “mummified remains”.
The collection contains bodies going back as far as 5,500 years.
And at 
 Great North Museum: Hancock, a mummified woman will be known only by her name Irtyru.
The word is linked to horror films such as smash hit 
.
The word mummy has been used in English since at least 1615.
Some say it has a colonial past, being derived from “mummiya”, the Arabic word for the the bitumen used as an embalming substance.
Critics blasted the new terms. 
Campaign for Real Education’s Chris McGovern said: “The curse of the mummy is driving these academics mad!”
British Museum said its displays “emphasised that mummified remains are of people who once lived”.
