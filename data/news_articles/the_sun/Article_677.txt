A GIANT 2ft long, 16lb baby has been born by caesarean section.
Doctors 
 after realising he was too big to arrive naturally.
He was “stable” in an incubator yesterday at Hospital Padre Colombo in Parintins, 
.
Mum Cleidiane Santos dos Santos, 27, was said to be doing well.
Hospital staff are raising funds to help her buy new clothes for her son as he will not fit the ones she bought.
The heaviest ever baby was a 22½lb boy born to Carmelina Fedele in Aversa, Italy, in 1955, say Guinness World Records.
The hospital has now launched a fundraising campaign to help Angerson's parents, as all the baby clothes they have bought will be too small for their newborn.
The facility is collecting extra-large nappies and clothes for infants aged between nine months and a year.
