AN OVER 40 woman refuses to cut herself off from trendy clothing. 
Kristy Swain (
) admitted she follows the influence of her teenage daughters and dresses younger than her age. 
The swanky mom posted a 
 to show off a stylish look she got from her daughters. 
And she exposed more skin than a typical parent may usually reveal. 
Kristy turned to the side to hide the full view of her outfit.
"Buying trendy things cause of my two teenage daughters," Kristy said. 
The blonde-haired TikTok user stepped forward in gray jogger sweatpants, a wine-colored tight tank top, and white high-top sneakers. 
A famous quote from the film Mean Girls rang in the background of the video to characterize Kristy's thoughts. 
"You girls keep me young. Ugh, I love you so much," the sound repeated. 
Kristy moved closer to the camera as she held an oversized water bottle. 
"I won't dress my age," Kristy declared. 
Her viewers didn't think she should. 
"You wear the outfit well," one follower said. 
Another kind individual wrote: "Good morning beautiful, you look great." 
"You look great for your age," a sweet viewer proclaimed. 
"Strut yo stuff!!! YOU keep you young!! Forget the others. Own your energy," a follower encouraged. 
A supportive fan said: "You can pull that look off...looks good." 
One keen man asked: "Can you keep me young?"
