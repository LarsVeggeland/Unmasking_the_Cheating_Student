A PLUS-SIZE content creator has given her followers an inspirational reminder to women who are insecure about wearing bikinis.
Posting to her TikTok account 
, Sophie Ann Sophie posed in a leopard print bikini. 
She used the audio from another video that began by saying, “So I’m not trying to body shame anybody, but girls who are over like 130 pounds and go out in bikinis and crop tops and short shorts…”
Sophie pointed to the number above her head that revealed she was 155 pounds.
While the first part of the audio sounded like it was about to criticize certain women for their weight, thankfully it took a positive turn.
“You look f**king amazing!” the voiceover said.
Sophie looked gorgeous as she adjusted her tiny high-leg bottom and bandeau style top.
To signal her love for women who look like her, she blew a kiss at the end of the clip.
Her caption was meant to give a further confidence boost to her viewers: “Here, have this random video from my drafts. Because bikini szn is hard for some of us!! But if this is on your FYP, you look absolutely amazing luv.”
Because she had an insulin pump for diabetes, called an Omnipod, on her stomach in the clip, many viewers praised her relatability:
“YAS queen the omnipod! We love to see it,” one person wrote.
“I LOVE SEEING MY DIABUDDIES THRIVING. THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY,” added another.
"This! You were positive about you without being negative on others!" a third chimed in.
