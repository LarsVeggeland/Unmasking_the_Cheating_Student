A WOMAN who flew to Turkey in the hope of getting her dream smile has shared harrowing footage of her recovery process.
 describes the experience as ‘the worst thing she’s ever done’, and is now using her TikTok to warn others against having dental surgery abroad.
In a recent video, Katie shared a video she had filmed of herself just hours after her procedure to have veneers fitted which left her bedbound.
Barely able to speak she says: “It’s been 15 hours in the dentist, I’ve currently got my temps (temporary veneers) in.”
The video then skips to 48 hours after the procedure.
Katie continues: “I’m currently in a lot of pain and agony, I have been ever since. 
“My face is swollen and I’ve got no feeling (above my lip) I’ve barely been able to get out of bed once today.”
Katie then shared footage of her ‘thick’ temporary veneers followed by photo after photo of herself bed-bound ‘sleeping as much as she possibly could.’
The TikToker revealed in 
that her surgery had cost her £6,000 and left her needing stitches when she returned to the UK.
As part of this surgery she received 13 root canals and had 24 teeth shaved down, which she now describes as the “worst feeling ever.”
And while the final result certainly looked shiny and white, Katie says that the dental surgeon had actually left the tooth impressions in her gums.
Her UK dentist actually found impressions left in five areas within her mouth, and she has had to get several stitches getting all of this removed.
She says that she now wants to warn people of the dangers of going to Turkey to get teeth done, adding that she’s posted her video to raise awareness.
