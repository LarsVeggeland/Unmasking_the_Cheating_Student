Casinos in the UK are licensed by the UK Gambling Commission. Casinos need to hold the relevant operating licence, such as an online or land-based licence, and must comply with the provisions of the Gambling Act 2005, which is designed to prevent crime and risk of fraudulent activity such as money laundering. The Gambling Act also aims to protect children and establish fair conditions in gambling venues for a player.
The UK Gambling Commission has a searchable public register, so you can check if the casino you are considering is a licensed operator and find out other information about it, such as where it is registered and if there are any sanctions or settlements imposed on it by the Gambling Commission as a result of regulatory action or investigation. 
With online casinos, you can also check the domain names they use to ensure that the site you are on is genuine and not one that has mimicked or cloned a legitimate site.
Another way to ensure that the site you are on is genuine and not one that has mimicked or cloned a legitimate site is to look for security features such as HTTPS in the URL, a lock icon in the browser, and a valid SSL certificate, as well as to check the website's contact information and privacy policy.
Online casinos generally offer a vast game selection, including hundreds of slot machines, table games, video poker, live casino games, bingo games, and other specialty games.
The team at the online casino have worked hard to provide an extensive selection of the most popular slot games with UK players, such as Starburst, Book of Dead, and Mega Fortune, that offer exciting casino bonus features and thrilling gameplay to keep players entertained.
Table games include classic casino games, such as roulette, poker, blackjack, craps, and baccarat.
Yes, you can. Most UK casinos have excellent mobile apps for iOS and Android that you can download on your phone for free and install on any device. Many also have fully responsive, mobile-friendly sites, so you can choose to play on your computer, mobile, or tablet without downloading an app if you prefer.
You can withdraw your winnings at any time by requesting a withdrawal in your online account. All casinos have terms and conditions, and these may include things such as a minimum withdrawal amount depending on the payment method, so check this out before signing up. Problems with processing withdrawals may mean that you have not verified your identity and payment details. 
Another common reason for withdrawal problems is that you are trying to withdraw bonus funds or cash winnings from bonus funds but have not met the conditions of the bonus, such as the wagering requirements or eligibility. Again, check the terms and conditions carefully before playing to ensure that you can meet all requirements.
Yes, you can sign up at different casinos, and even claim the welcome bonuses at each one. The only time you may run into a problem with this is if two casinos are part of the same group and owned by the same parent company.  For existing members, it is important to note that you may not be eligible for the welcome bonus amount, as you may not be classed as a new customer; however, you may still be able to take advantage of other promotional offers and rewards available to all members.
It depends on the casino, but yes, many casinos also run an online sportsbook, so you can wager money on sports at your online casino, often using the same account. 
When creating a sports betting account or placing your first bet, it is important to be aware of any restrictions that may apply, such as min. deposit amounts, max. bet amounts, or any other restrictions that may be in place in order to ensure a safe and secure betting experience.
