The 
 hope to see the 18-year-old before deciding on a move when his Blues deal runs out in the summer.
Thomas played for 
 in an Under-21 game during an extended trial but the Blades need a defensive full-back.
The Blues ace started as a winger so is ideal for a team with wing-backs.
Despite being in the market for a full-back, Blades boss Paul Heckingbottom is open to signing the teenager and could rival Saints for his signature.
He said of Thomas: "I've not seen him yet, he played in a game we couldn't get to.
"All my feedback has been through Del and Micky regarding him.
"We know what his qualities are in terms of his attacking intent. 
"He's a front-footed player.
"He played wing-back for us and it adds a different dimension to his game there. 
"Macca [Stuart McCall] watched him in the game, but I couldn't get.
"It's something we'll be led on by Del and Micky.
"If we get to a point where everyone's happy, then we'll come and have a good look.
"If we get to a point where everyone's happy, then we'll come and have a good look."
Thomas has made eight appearances for Chelsea's reserves this campaign.
