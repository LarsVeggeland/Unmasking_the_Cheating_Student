ALEXIS SANCHEZ has made a subtle dig at Manchester United ahead of their clash with Arsenal this afternoon.
The Chilean famously ditched the Gunners for 
 in January 2018.
But in the build-up to their crunch match today, 
 has made no secret of where his allegiances still lie.
After 
 posted a goal of his from a previous clash with United to Instagram, the 34-year-old responded emotionally.
He wrote: "You remembered me. I will never forget you too.
"You will always be in my heart. You were my first family in England.
"And everyone took good care of me especially the fans!
"All the best Gunners!"
Sanchez scored 80 goals in 166 appearances for Arsenal after joining from 
 in 2014 - also laying on 45 assists.
He went on to run his contract down, however, moving to United with just six months left in a swap deal for Henrikh Mkhitaryan.
His move to Old Trafford was not a successful one, as he scored just five goals in 45 outings.
He moved to Inter Milan, initially on loan, in 2019.
Sanchez helped the Italian giants win Serie A in 2021 and the Coppa Italia in 2022 during his time at San Siro.
The forward moved to Marseille in Ligue 1 last summer, and has bagged nine goals in 23 games for the French side.
