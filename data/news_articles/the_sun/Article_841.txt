DEAR DEIDRE: AFTER using social media to track down a woman I met on a train, I am now gutted to learn she has got a boyfriend.
It took me months to find her and I now half-wish I’d never begun the search.
I’m 32 and met her while travelling down to London from Manchester.
We chatted, but I didn’t have the bottle to get her full name or ask her out.
Weeks of thinking about her and kicking myself led me to try to find her using the scant information I had.
I put out requests on Facebook and even in some London newspapers.
Every problem gets a personal reply from one of our trained counsellors.

You can also send a private message on the 
 Facebook page.
Amazingly, it worked. She messaged me but said she was sorry, she had a long-term partner and couldn’t keep in touch.
She asked me to take down all my posts, which made me feel like a stalker.
I know it isn’t personal, but I can’t help taking it as another 
.
You built up your hopes and imagined a future together, so it’s natural that after all your efforts this feels like a slap in the face.
You didn’t get your fairytale ending, but time will heal.
You are clearly a genuine, resourceful and romantic guy, so keep getting out there and meeting new people – that’s the best way to find a partner.
In the meantime, my support pack, Moving On, should help.
