A 31-YEAR-OLD retired Hooters girl recovered her treasured get-up. 
Brittany Linn pulled out her exclusive version of the franchise uniform from the 2010s that only some women still have. 
The resigned waitress posted a 
 on her TikTok (
) to show the old orange and white 
. 
While the typical Hooters outfit is cropped now, Brittany's was long and covering. 
She zipped up her full-length long-sleeve track suit top. 
The restaurant's name is stitched in cursive across the chest. 
Each arm-sleeve has a thumb hole at the end. 
Her bottoms are matching track pants with an orange stripe down the side. 
A Hooters logo is printed on the inside of her hip on the pants. 
Brittany's undershirt is similar to the restaurant's uniforms now. 
She wore a tiny T-shirt that cut off just below her chest. 
The top had a V-cut neckline. 
She clipped her name tag on the white undershirt before she showed the little pocket added on one sleeve of the jacket. 
Brittany stuck her hands in her pockets and twisted to give viewers the full view. 
Her 2010 uniform is more conservative compared to the booty shorts and crop tops the staff has now.   
"Only the elite Hooters girls still have the jumpsuits," she said. 
In a previous 
, Brittany revealed old photos of her from her days at the restaurant. 
She's seen in tinier clothes sitting outside the establishment and serving tables inside. 
"Seriously, the best years of my life," she admitted.
