WE’VE all been in embarrassing situations where we just wish we could turn back time.
A woman named Maria said she wanted to run and hide when she accidentally showed the checkout guy at UPS an intimate photo of herself.
Maria shared the hilarious story with her followers on TikTok (
) moments after it happened.
She headed to UPS to ship out a few returns, and instead of using printed labels, she used QR codes on her phone.
“So, the man behind the desk was like, ‘Alright dope. Let me see the QR codes.’ And I was like, ‘Easy peasy.’”
She opened up the photos app on her phone and showed him the first code.
“I then slide my finger over for the next one and I show it to him. And he goes, ‘Oh!’”
Maria was confused by his reaction.
“So I go, ‘What?’
“Then he looks at me, looks at the phone, looks at me, looks at the phone.
“I then look at the phone and realize it is my bare a** and it’s a nude I took.”
Although Maria was clearly embarrassed by her overexposure, she found humor in the situation.
Her viewers in the comments section clearly did too.
“Best tip he’ll get,” one person wrote.
“Pulls out his personal phone to scan that code,” joked another.
“How do I get a job at UPS,” a third chimed.
“POV: You’re the luckiest UPS guy on earth,” said a fourth.
Thankfully, an actual employee reassured her that this isn’t the first time this happens: “Fellow UPS store worker here. I promise you are not the only one to do that. It happens more often than you think.”
