LOVE Island fans have noticed that Haris is missing something – his armpit hair.
The
 appears to be clean shaven, like many sportsmen are, but the absence has distracted those watching at home.
One person remarked: “Woah
shaves his armpits?”
“Erm why does Harris have smoother armpits than me 🤨😂,” questioned a second.
While someone else wrote: “Haris stop shaving your armpits mate x.”
As another added: “So confused. Boys shave their armpits now?.”
Last night’s Love Island saw TV salesman Haris and airport security officer 
come to blows following a dramatic game of beer pong.
New bombshell 
, who is a property developer, choose to kiss biomedical student 
- who is currently coupled with Shaq.
After the game, Haris quizzed Shaq, 24, over the kiss, which provoked Shaq to call him out for antagonising the situation and a shouting match ensued.
Tonight’s episode will see Haris and Shaq catch up following the beer pong fallout, with Haris saying: "The only thing that got to me is to call me a 's*** stirrer', that's a big thing."
Meanwhile Shaq says: "I get that you're young and you've got all this energy and things like that, but sometimes you need to understand certain situations and know what to say, and when to say it, and I don't think you get that."
The episode will also see the first recoupling of the series which will see the last boy left standing immediately dumped from the island.
