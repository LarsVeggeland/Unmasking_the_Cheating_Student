The video title reads: 'Your van is broken.'
The issue is often called 'dog tracking' and occurs when the rear wheels have been knocked out of alignment. 
If drivers notice this on their car, they should get it sorted out immediately. 
Not only will it affect a car's handling, but it will cause tyres to wear unevenly. 
This van has probably bumped a kerb while backing up or has driven through a deep pothole.
Aggressive driving, carrying heavy loads, bent or worn suspension/steering parts and accidents can also cause misalignment. 
Viewers were quick to comment on the video.
One said: "I think the subframe is bent."
Another said: "I don't get it, LOL."
While a third pointed out: "Haha. I just realised what's wrong."
