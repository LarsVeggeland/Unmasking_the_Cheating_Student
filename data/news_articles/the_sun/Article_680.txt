LOVE Island is set to get even more exciting this weekend – as two very family faces enter the villa.
At the end of tonight’s episode it was revealed
from the Australian version of the show will be heading in, ready to cause some serious chaos – leaving viewers in shock.
They are
who was on the show Down Under in series three, and 
, famed for being in series two, in 2019.
Those watching at home had mixed feelings about it, with one writing:  "Omg wow as if love island Australia is crashing love island uk! 😂 ."
A second said: "Now these Australian islanders are actually bombshells."
And a third added:  "Oh god. The Aussies are here. It’s about to be a hot mess. Them guys don’t play 😂😂."
Model Aaron, 25, was a huge hit on his series and was crowned runner up alongside Jess Velkovski.
Speaking about how he will do things differently this time, he said: “When I was in the Love Island Australia Villa, I didn’t open myself up to other opportunities that I could’ve possibly had.
“This time round I want to be testing the waters by being open-minded and giving everyone a chance.”
Jessie, 26, became a villa legend with her drama and one-liners during her time  on the show and coupled up with four different men.
She said about doing the show: “I’m single and have been for quite some time! I’m very lucky to live the life I lead, but it does get a bit lonely.
“All of my friends are settling down, and it’s time for me to do the same. The last time I had a relationship, it was in the Love Island Australia Villa - so let’s go!”
ITV streams the Australian and American versions on its hub - now known as ITVX - so the two will be familiar faces to UK viewers.
Last year ITV made waves when they welcomed 2018 bad boy Adam Collard back into the villa 
 - a move that was 
 after his debut was shrouded in controversy over the way he treated the girls.
