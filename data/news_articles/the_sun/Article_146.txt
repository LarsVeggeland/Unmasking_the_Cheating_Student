The title was vacated by Jiri Prochazka because of injury, setting up a clash between Hill and Teixeira at UFC 283 in Rio De Janeiro.
Hill, 31, dominated his Brazilian opponent and left the home crowd disappointed after securing a win via unanimous decision.
Former champion Teixeira, who lost the title to Prochazka in his previous fight, called quits on his fighting career after the bout.
Just as Mauricio Shogun Rua did earlier in the night, the 43-year-old left his gloves in the octagon and announced his retirement.
He said: "I'm too tough for my own good, my own health, it is an honour to put the gloves down on the same night as Shogun."
Teixeira even escorted his opponent out of the venue after the fight to avoid the American being pelted with missiles thrown by fans.
Hill was delighted with the win after making history as the first athlete to become champion after earning a 
 contract via president 
's Contender Series.
He said: "Anything is possible with hard work and dedication, too many people told me I couldn't do it, that it wasn't possible. 
"I had to fight to be here, to live, to have a chance, you can do anything if you're willing to fight for it."
Hill had to scrap during the fight and was left with a few cuts and bruises.
And while in his corner in between rounds a coach poured water over his head, which turned red with blood.
