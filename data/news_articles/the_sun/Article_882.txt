THE aftermath of the villa's most brutal fight yet plays out in tonight's Love Island - and a first look clip has given a peek at the drama.
In a spoiler video shared on Love Island's official instagram, Haris is seen walking over to Shaq who is cooling off after the bust up that saw them have to be separated.
The boys shake hands and hug, before Haris says: "Quick one bro, it's going to be a quick one. The only thing that got to me is to call me a s**t stirrer is a big thing, that's it."
But Shaq is not ready to forgive and forget immediately.
He fires back:"I  get that you are young and you've got all this energy and things like that, but sometimes you need to understand certain situations and know what to say, and when to say it, and I don't think you get that."
Haris is seen biting his lip as he listens to Shaq while Tanya, on the other side of the garden with Tom, David and Zara, watches on and weighs in.
 "Everyone needs to take a frickin chill, a big fat chill pill. Calm down! relax!" she says, clearly frustrated.
Also upset is Zara, who is isolated after Olivia walked off with the other girls following the new bombshell labelling her tow faced.
Asked if she is OK by David, Zara responds: "I'm good like, but I mean, the girls have kind of all gathered around her."
"Listen emotions are running high for everyone," David reassures her.
It comes after the villa was thrown into chaos following a game of dares during beer pong.
