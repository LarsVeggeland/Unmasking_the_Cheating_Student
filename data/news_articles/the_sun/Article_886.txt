A WOMAN was savaged in a horrifying dog attack after the beast ran at her as she walked to her car.
The victim was walking to her car in Grays, 
 when she was left with eight deep wounds to her leg.
Having undergone surgery, she is now forced to live with permanent scaring.
The bull breed dog was running wild before mauling the woman in September 2021, Basildon Combined Court heard.
Owner Peter Fricker, 43, has now been jailed for 18 months for allowing the dog to be dangerously out of control.
He was also banned from keeping a dog for 10 years.
The dog was seized and destroyed after the incident. 
PC Jack Emerson said “We welcome the court’s decision which reflects the danger posed by dangerous dogs and those who fail to keep adequate control of them.
"I hope that this sentence sends the message to owners that whilst they are incredible pets, dogs can pose a risk if not properly trained and cared for, and owners must ensure that they have adequate knowledge, capability, and the right environment to care for them.”
