TEMPLEGATE tackles Saturday's racing confident of finding a few winners.
The frost has played havoc with the jumps action - but there's a Flat feast on show at Lingfield.
Our man reckons Ryan Moore can boot home a winning Nap on his first rides in Britain since last October.
While you're here, check out 
 as we count down to the big one in March.
And find out why 
 in the near future.
This four-year-old spent the early part of his career with Jessica Harrington in Ireland before moving across to join the excellent George Boughey in Dorset.
He made his UK debut over this course and distance just before Christmas and scorched home to win going away.
She returned to all-weather action with a smooth win at Lingfield over a mile on New Year’s Eve. William Haggas steps her up in distance here but that shouldn’t be an issue as she looks like an improver.
Two of the shrewdest all-weather operators in Tony Carroll and Luke Morris team up with this in-form sprinter.
He landed a good victory here in November and went close again at Wolverhampton last time.
