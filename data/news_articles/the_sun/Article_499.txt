HAVE loads of clothes but always struggle with what to wear in the morning? 
Luckily one woman has shared the ‘genius’ way she gets around this - by making an outfit catalogue on her phone using pictures of outfits she’s worn before. 
Victoria, known online as 
, regularly shares 
 and 
 inspiration with her 11,600 followers. 
In a new video, she shares how she makes getting dressed every morning easier - and people are stunned they didn’t think of it. 
“Me taking a picture and saving it in my outfit catalogue for when I don’t know what to wear.”
Below the video, she added: “Seriously the best thing I’ve ever done!!” 
In another video, she explains how iPhone users can make their own catalogues using their selfies.  
She said: “It’s actually super easy. 
“3D press your image and then copy it, and then go into your notes and create a new album. 
“I named mine ‘photo album’ just because it is what it is. 
“And then I hit the … up in the corner and I did light background instead of dark background so I can see my outfits better duh. 
“And then you just copy and paste it. 
“You 3D tap it again and you’ll hit ‘small images’ and that’s how you do it.”
Fans loved the savvy idea, with the video gaining more than 528,000 likes and 4.3 million views. 
In the comments, Victoria’s followers praised the easy tutorial, with one writing: “This is literally genius.”
Another said: “This reminds me of Cher’s outfit computer in Clueless.”
A third put: “The smartest thing I’ve ever seen on Tiktok.”
Someone else put: “No one has ever been more intelligent. This is a turning point in human achievement.”
