MOLLY-MAE Hague fans claim she's given birth to her first child after returning to social media with a touching post.
The Love Island star, 23, paid tribute to her pregnancy body and said the process had been a "dream".
Cradling her bump wearing a white robe inside her home, she said: "I really couldn’t have asked my body to provide a better home for the first 9 months of our little girls life… so blessed to say my pregnancy has been a complete and utter dream🤍👼🏼."
 replied: "Love you."
And close pal 
 left love heart emojis.
Molly previously revealed she was full term and fans are on tenterhooks to know if her little one is here.
One commented: "Ohhh does this mean she’s here???"
Another said: "By the sounds of it she’s had her baby for but keeping it quiet to let them enjoy it first before exposing it to social media! Xxxx."
A third said: "Wahh is she here!!?? I kept saying to my colleagues 
 is quiet."
The PrettyLittleThing creative director recently told fans that while she was at the end of her pregnancy, she was unwilling to reveal the exact due date.
She said: “Here I am. Here is baby girl, full term. I am now nine months pregnant.”
Molly addressed the due date rumours in another video last week and told fans that she only had "a couple of weeks" left before giving birth.
Molly-Mae shared: "I know I've not been like specific with dates, and due dates, and everything but I'm not obviously at the very end of my third trimester. I have done most of it.”
She continued: " I literally only have a couple weeks left now before I give birth. It's crazy. I'm still not going to be specific about due dates like I've been, that's literally my most asked question."
The happy couple, who met on Love Island in 2019, announced their baby news in September and later revealed they are expecting a girl.
