EMMERDALE fans are in shock as Caleb Miligan revealed his true colours tonight in his war against Cain Dingle.
The businessman - who is played by actor Will Ash in the 
 - has presented himself as a decent stand-up guy.
Viewers have watched as Caleb has seemingly done his best to ingratiate himself with his birth family.
He has paid a fortune for Kyle Winchester’s defence for killing Al Chapman - though fans did question whether he really did accidentally convince the youngster to confess.
But with Cain resolute in not letting Caleb into his life, the businessman just keeps pushing.
And in tonight’s episode Caleb tracked his brother down and revealed he had been keeping an eye on him.
Caleb kept pushing Cain, and attempted to wind him up.
“You can’t stand it can you?” Caleb said desperate to get a rise out of Cain. 
“I’m the better brother, I’m the better everything. I’m doing better for Kyle than you ever could.”
His words worked and Cain flew off the handle advancing on Caleb with a weapon - before Amy walked in to see what was happening.
But as Cain tried to defend himself, Caleb lied and insisted Cain just came at him with the weapon - leaving Amy furious.
She told Cain he wouldn’t be seeing Kyle and later revealed plans to go for full custody.
Fans are in shock after Caleb’s plan saw Cain lose his son Kyle.

Another added: "Can someone tie Caleb up and feed him to the pigs?"
