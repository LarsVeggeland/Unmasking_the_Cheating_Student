EASTENDERS star Kelsey Calladine-Smith looks worlds apart from character Jada in stunning Instagram pictures.
The 17-year-old is far cry from the single teen mum and instead leads a very glamorous life.
While Jada is rarely seen in anything other than a tracksuit on the 
 soap, Kelsey loves to get glammed up and to experiment with her hair.
When she’s not filming in Walford, the actress visits London’s top restaurants with her friends and enjoys exotic holidays.
She has previously shared photos of herself soaking up the sun in Miami – looking world’s away from Jada, who lives with Sharon.
Before joining 
, Kelsey appeared as Indigo Moon in The Worst Witch and also as Young Nala in the Lion King musical.
Jada first appeared on the soap when she left her daughter Alyssa on Sharon’s doorstep asking her to look after her.
It later transpired that Alyssa was Sharon’s late son Denny’s child.
When Kelsey first landed the gig on the soap, she told her followers: “I am so happy to finally announce that I have joined the @bbceastenders cast !!My first episode airs tonight at 8pm or catch up on @bbciplayer.
“A BIG thank you to my amazing agents @sainoutalent
“I am so excited and I hope you guys are too. Thank you to everyone who has supported me along the way, it means a lot to me.”
