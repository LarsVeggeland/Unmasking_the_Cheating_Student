A LOTTERY winner who scooped £250,000 has been jailed — for failing to pay a £12,000 debt.
Prosecutors pursued Gerry Donaldson, 52, for his crime profits after he was convicted of growing cannabis.
An initial confiscation order was made for £11,750 after the hash operation was busted during a 2018 raid on his home in Hawick, Roxburghshire.
At Jedburgh Sheriff Court last week, it emerged that figure had now risen to £12,335 with interest. 
Prosecutor Fiona Hamilton said investigators found the grandad — who won big on a scratchcard in 2010 — had received £36,000 in March 2021 from the sale of his home,
But the only asset he now appeared to own was a motor. 
She added: “He won a significant amount on the lottery some time ago but there are no details on where this has gone.”
Caging him for a year, Sheriff Peter Paterson said the amount owed would still be sought despite his jail sentence.
A neighbour said: “It does seem incredible how someone can go through so much money from a lottery period in such a short period.
“He had his kids to look after which is fair enough but to have nothing left from getting such a huge sum and now being sent to jail is such a downturn.
“He still has to pay back the money as well - it shows that winning the lottery doesn’t solve all your problems.”
