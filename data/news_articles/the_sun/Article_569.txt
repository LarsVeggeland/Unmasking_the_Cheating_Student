BBC Breakfast's Naga Munchetty wowed viewers today in a tight-fitting leopard print dress.
This week the broadcaster, 47, revealed it only takes her 16 minutes to get ready in the morning, but viewers would be forgiven for thinking it takes far longer. 
Appearing today in her trademark colourful specs and funky outfit, it wasn't long before viewers voiced their appreciation for the strong look.
One posted a picture of the star on screen and wrote on Twitter: "The lovely 
 presenting Saturday's BBC Breakfast."
Another overenthusiastic viewer, said "woohoo" after seeing the stylish ensemble.
Speaking to the 
 this week about her early morning routine, Naga said: “I am always buzzing. I’m buzzing before I start the show, because you have to go in with that energy.” 
Despite having to wake up at 3.45am, Naga never feels sleep-deprived.
She explained: “As long as I get my block of five hours, I’m fine… I’ve timed my routine to 16 minutes. Everything is laid out: face moisturiser, hair wax, body moisturiser, deodorant – it’s all in the same order every single time.”
Today's edition of Breakfast saw Naga grill deputy prime minister Dominic Raab over prime minister Rishi Sunak's failure to wear a seat belt while recording a video for voters in the back of a moving car.
