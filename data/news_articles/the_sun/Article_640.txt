with series of clever tricks when posting online.

 – has been careful not to show much of her stomach in recent months.
Pictures have either been cut off at her shoulders, or she has used props to cover herself.
In one snap over Christmas, her son Santi is seen on her lap and a strategically placed arm means nothing can be seen.

She has also been wearing much darker colours than usual and using shirts to cover herself.
Tonight Dani broke the news as she posted a snap of Santi holding her scans, and wrote: "We have been keeping a little secret... Our little TWINS ♡ ♡
"So excited to meet our babies and watch Santi be the best big brother..
"The biggest surprise of our lives but feeling SO blessed.. our family is getting a lot bigger and we can’t wait✨."
