LOVE Island's Paige Turley looks completely unrecognisable just two years after appearing on the show.
The reality star participated in the smash-hit 
series during its first ever winter edition.
Scottish woman Paige went on to win the show with Finley Tapp after 43 days in the reality villa.
Following the show, the couple dashed 400 miles to quarantine together before 
 restrictions kicked in, and they remain shacked up to this day in their swanky 
 pad.
Paige is currently working on her music, while Finn signed a deal with a modelling agency.
And the 25-year-old has revealed a brand new look as she starts off the New Year.
She was snapped on a glam night out as she wore a blue PVC dress.
The skin-tight frock showed off her incredible body as she smiled for the camera.
She completed the look with gold open-toe heels and small white bag.
It comes as the brand new series of Love Island kicks off tonight on ITV2 and ITVX.
New host 
 will welcome the new islanders to a brand new villa as they soak up some winter soon in the hope of finding love.
Five boys and five girls are 
 in tonight's
 launch show.
But following the first coupling of the series and as the islanders begin to get to know each other, the Islanders are shocked to discover the public have been voting for the first bombshell of the series.
Following the public vote, either 25-year-old
, from Norwich, or 23-year-old 
, a semi-pro footballer from Barnsley, will enter the villa to shake things up as the first
bombshell.
