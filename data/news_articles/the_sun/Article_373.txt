TROLLS can't stop themselves from commenting on women's personal clothing choices. 
Luckily, this content creator doesn't take it personally – she redirects her attention to her fans instead.
The TikTok user, who goes by her handle @54n4a online, mimicked some of her most invasive critics 
Standing against a door, the content creator looked totally relaxed in her casual outfit.
She wore low-slung sweatpants and a cropped, white camisole – with no bra, per her usual. 
In the video's caption, she quoted the confused comment she hears online and in real life. 
"You never wear a bra," the passive-aggressive statement read.
Pointing up at the statement, the woman let her hands fall away. 
She wasn't even invested enough in others' opinions to shoo them away. 
"I don't care," she mouthed, shaking her head.
In the video's description, she added a call to action for her fellow women. "Be free!" she wrote.
"I respect it," one man wrote in the comments, quick to throw his support behind her.
Another anonymous commenter said the issue shouldn't be up for debate.
"I mean it’s your choice, to be honest," they wrote. "Shouldn’t matter to others."
"None of the boys are complaining," a man pointed out.
The comments section flooded with men who wanted to show their dedication to the cause – many for selfish reasons.
"I don't want you to," said one person who preferred the creator's silhouette without a bra.
Another chimed in with a unique offer. "I can always hold 'em for support," he said.
