Prince Harry has recalled the moment William "recoiled" after Meghan leaned in to hug him during their first meeting.
He explains: “I introduced Meg, who leaned in and gave him a hug, which completely freaked him out. He recoiled.”
He adds: “Maybe Willy expected Meg to curtsy? It would have been protocol when meeting a member of the Royal Family for the first time, but she didn’t know and I didn’t tell her.”
When Harry and Meghan were expecting Lilibet, their lives were way different from when they had Archie and still had a royal role.
When expecting Lilibet, the Duke said how he wanted to be the first person Lilibet sees.

Harry was left speechless replying: “Really?” with Meghan giving him reassurance by repeating the words."

While another said: “Great work guys! As always, just getting on with the job of making a difference to others less fortunate.”

Royal experts have predicted King Charles' coronation could be an even grander affair than her late Majesty's Platinum Jubilee.
Constitutional expert Dr Bob Morris, of University College London, said: "It will be very grand and will probably eclipse the Queen’s funeral and Platinum Jubilee in terms of pageantry.
"There will be more bands and more people.
"It will certainly be an amazing sight. But it won’t be the grand affair we had in 1953, which had all the colonial troops. It will feel less imperial."

Harry on 
: "Several close mates and beloved figures in my life, including one of Hugh and Emilie's sons, Emilie herself, and even Tiggy, had chastised me for Oprah.
"How could you reveal such things? About your family? I told them that I failed to see how speaking to Oprah was any different from what my family and their staffs had done for decades — briefing the press on the sly, planting stories....
"The only difference was that Meg and I were upfront about it.
"We chose an interviewer who was above reproach, and we didn't once hide behind phrases like 'Palace sources,' we let people see the words coming out of our mouths."
Harry on Tyler Perry: "We were having a chat with Tyler Perry, the actor-writer-director.
"He'd sent a note to Meg before the wedding, out of the blue, telling her that she wasn't alone, that he saw what was happening.
"Now, FaceTiming with him, Meg and I were trying to put on a brave face, but we were both a mess. Tyler saw. He asked what was up.
"We gave him the highlights, the loss of security, the borders closing. Nowhere to turn.
"'Whoa. OK, that's a lot. But... just breathe. Breathe.'
"That was the problem. We couldn't breathe.
"'Look... take my house.'
"'What?'
"'My house in Los Angeles. It's gated, it's secure — you'll be safe there. I'll keep you safe.'"

"Often I'd catch Elton studying Archie's face and I knew what he was thinking: Mummy. I knew because it happened so often to me as well.
"Time and again I'd see an expression cross Archie's face and it would bring me up short.
"I nearly said so to Elton, how much I wished my mother could hold her grandson, how often it happened that, while hugging Archie, I felt her — or wanted to.
"Every hug tinged with nostalgia; every tuck-in touched with grief."

"Goodnight my darling Ella, Alizee and the dogs will take good care of me.
Relationship expert Valon Asani spoke with 
 on how Prince Harry can follow these five steps to mend his relationship with the royal family.
Asani said that first Harry and his family need to acknowledge and have sympathy for the struggles they've been through.
Then they need to find a "common ground" such as an activity over which they can bond over.
The next step is to reach out for an olive branch. Asani explained that if Harry and Meghan are invited to the King's Coronation, they should go.
He added how establishing boundaries and respecting them is another important step in reconciling.
Finally, they need to take it slow and not rush because relationships aren't amended in a split of a second.

The Prince of Wales made a royal visit to Together As One in Slough, which is a charity that helps tackle young gang violence.
Prince William joined a group of young carers that learnt about food nutrition and upped their cooking skills with chef and teacher Kevin Muhammad.
The Prince learnt how to make teriyaki chicken with the group but admitted that he is not the best when it comes to cooking.
The chef revealed that during his talks with the Prince, William admitted that he doesn't like when Kate puts fresh coriander in their dishes, hinting that the Princess of Wales does the cooking.
Chef Muhammad added, as per

He told the podcast: “When I was younger, Harry and I, we were at boarding school. And my mother used to play all sorts of songs to kind of while away the anxiety of going back to school.
“And one of the songs I massively remember and has stuck with me all this time, and I still, to this day, still quite enjoy secretly, is Tina Turner’s “The Best” because sitting in the backseat, singing away, it felt like a real family moment.
“And my mother, she’d be driving along, singing at the top of her voice. And we’d even get the policeman in the car, he’d be occasionally singing along, as well.”

During the call, he said: "We have got people like you guys looking out for each other and supporting each other – that’s what really matters, and so you are getting everyone through it.
"Please make sure you are looking after yourselves and those in your communities who need because some people will be suffering in silence. I just want to make sure that you’re all looking out for yourselves as well as each other. It’s really important."

Heartening but heartbreaking to speak with some of those affected by the serious flooding in Australia. 
As ever, their sense of community and selflessness is humbling, but it is terrible that such devastation seems to be occurring more often.

The Duke of Sussex referred to an unofficial biography by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand published in August 2020 about his and his wife's life in his memoir.
The book claimed that Meghan underwent a "mock kidnapping" to prepare for "all high-risk security scenarios" making it an "extremely intense and scary" experience for her.
In his memoir Spare, Prince Harry hit out at the claims, writing: "A bestselling book describes the day Special Forces came to our house, grabbed Meg, put her through several intense days of drills, pushing her into back seats and car boots, speeding away to safe houses."
But in reality, Harry said the Duchess "wasn't given one minute of training."
He added: "On the contrary, the Palace floated the idea of not giving her any security at all because I was now sixth in line to the throne".
