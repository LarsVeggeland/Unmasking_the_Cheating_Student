THE rearranged Clarence House Chase featuring Energumene vs Edwardstone will now be held on Cheltenham Trials Day.
The 2m Grade 1 was supposed to be run at Ascot on Saturday.
But the brutal cold snap meant the meeting had to be abandoned on account of the frozen ground.
It means the big warm-up for March's Champion Chase at the same racecourse will now go ahead on the final meeting before the Festival.
A British Horseracing Authority statement confirmed: "The BHA has confirmed that the Clarence House Chase, which had been due to be run as part of Saturday's abandoned card at Ascot, will now take place at Cheltenham on Saturday 28 January.
"Following confirmation on Thursday that Ascot would be unable to race, all parties concerned were keen to see the Grade 1 rescheduled.
"The BHA is grateful to the Jockey Club for agreeing to host the race, which will be staged as the Albert Bartlett Clarence House Chase.
"This is also possible thanks to the support of the Horserace Betting Levy Board, who will pay both the normal rate card prize money as well as an additional contribution to prize money, to a total value of £46,000.

"As per the BHA policy on rescheduling early closing races, the £90,000 race will revert to the original early closing entries and progress through to confirmations on Monday 23 January before final declarations on Thursday 26 January."
Ascot clerk of the course Chris Stickels ruled out moving the Clarence House back 24 hours when speaking earlier this week.
He said: "There's a similar forecast for Saturday night so there's no option to move to Sunday.
"The thaw doesn't come until Monday going by the forecast."
