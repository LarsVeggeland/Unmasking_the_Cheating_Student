A second commented: “Everyone’s drunk as hell but not as drunk as Tom🤣 all sluring his words.”

"It's not that kind of show.  It wouldn't make sense - they want people kissing and being in bed together because they want to, not because they are drunk.”
On last night’s show the stars took part in a racy game of beer pong, but were given non alcoholic booze.
