 become the first islander to leave the villa as Will was saved by Lana. 
However, 
 fans have slammed Lana after she said "this decision is s***" before saving 
.
Taking to social media one fan said: "Hang on… like what was Lana’s comment of ‘even though this choice is s***’ between Will and David? The disrespect to them both, just as one is about to be sent home. RUDE."
Meanwhile fans were taken aback when Tanyel and Kai were having flirty banter about poo.
On Friday, it was revealed that 
 and 
 are set to join the line-up.
However, fans have been left scratching their heads about the international arrivals, after noticing the distance the potential couples would have to face after the show.
“What’s the point,” one furious fan hit out. “How are you going to find a genuine relationship if one will go back to Australia when the show’s done and the other back to the UK.”
A second agreed: “I’m sorry but how realistic is it for a UK/Ireland- Australian long distance relationship to work?”
A third said: “This is dumb, half the Islanders post show already can’t make long distance work across the UK.”
David Salako has opened up on his short-lived villa career following his dramatic dumping on Friday.
"Obviously you’ve got to go in hoping you have a chance," he said. 
"The four things she said during the re-coupling, I thought were about me, and then she picked Shaq. I was like, that’s wonderful…
"Me and Tanya did have a good bond. We just found it easy to have a conversation with each other. But maybe that’s all it was between us, just good conversation."
While Tanya and Shaq are going strong for now, David thinks more challenges are on the horizon.
"They’ve got a good bond, but they’ll have tests," he reflected. "Shaq will have a girl come in who likes him. 
So it’ll be interesting to see if his head turns. But for now they are a good couple, definitely."
Maya Jama has wowed fans as she took to Instagram to share a stunning make-up-free clip.
The star pouted for a selfie and filmed herself dancing around to Bad B****** by Breezy.
Maya has become an instant Love Island icon since making her debut as host on Monday.
Bombshell 
, from Wilmslow, 
, was escorted out by security after pushing co-star 
 for spilling wine on her and became the shortest-ever-lived contestant.
Malia, who appeared on the show in 2016, was banned from returning to the villa after her feud and says it "ruined" her career.
Explaining her time in the villa, she said: “I wanted to make a good impression, I didn’t want to find love straight away. I wanted to get comfortable and to know everyone.
“I think I went into the villa at around 12am or 1am to start filming and everyone was really drunk. They were all trying to find out the gossip and get updates.
“I gave Kady a hug and she was murmuring things under her breath about me, I knew she was going to start on me.
“She was tipsy so when she sat next to me - when I knew she didn’t like me -  I saw the glass of wine in her hand and knew she was going to pour it over me.
“I pushed her. I could never punch anyone. As soon as it happened security came and took me away."
.
All the action ( and more fireworks, we hope) kicks off from the villa at 9pm tonight on ITV2.
