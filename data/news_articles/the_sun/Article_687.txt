KATIE Price appeared to take a sneaky swipe at Kerry Katona this evening as she discussed OnlyFans.
Both women create content for the adult only site and 
is famously now a millionaire once again off the back of it.
Quizzed about if there was a rivalry between the pair, 
replied with what seemed to be a dig: “No, it doesn’t matter what you look like, OnlyFans is a platform anyone can go on.”
Speaking on GB News, the 44-year-old admitted: “I absolutely love getting my kit off which is why I do OnlyFans.
“When OnlyFans came along I was bit like ‘urgh’ because of the porn side because you can go as far as you like on it but you don’t have to do that.
“I have realised I am quite happy doing what I did beofore, underwear, swimwear and behind the scenes content that people don’t see on social media and I absolutely love it so much and I am good at it.”
She added:  “There is only one Pricey.”
Katie is hoping to rebuild her life like Kerry and revealed that she had played a part in getting her to sign up.
 “Kerry was trying to get me do it for ages and I am really pleased I did,” she said.
“Kerry is in a good place now and has turned herself around.”
Katie, who was declared bankrupt in 2019, is playing a comeback this year, which will include new perfume, clothes and even a fifth autobiography.
In preparation for that, Katie had her boobs enlarged recently and boasted: “They are the biggest there have even been.”
Asked if she would be getting more surgery, she exclaimed: “Oh my god that is just a no brainer.”
