A SCHOOL bus burst into flames with three terrified primary-aged children on board this morning. 
The 30-seater vehicle caught fire on a residential street, damaging six other vehicles and some of the surrounding properties. 
One of the children's mums took all three home to shield them from the sight of the blaze.
They had all got off before the London Fire Brigade arrived in Hackney, East London.
The bus had been forced to stop on the road when smoke was detected from the front. 
The force took 42 calls about it and had the blaze under control in less than an hour. 
Cllr Caroline Woodley said it is believed to be an isolated incident.
Hackney Council said: "This morning a fire broke out on a school bus in Hackney. The cause of the fire is yet to be determined. 
"All the children were evacuated with no injuries and a replacement bus was organised to deliver them to school."
Witnesses have claimed the area was not cordoned off despite there being debris "everywhere". 
Cars are said to be turning into the street, only to have to manoeuvre out of the way when they see the burnt out bus. 
London Fire Brigade said: "Firefighters tackled a bus fire on Wilton Way in Hackney this morning (January 20).
"A 30-seater bus was damaged by fire. Six other vehicles and a small part of several surrounding properties were also damaged by the blaze."
