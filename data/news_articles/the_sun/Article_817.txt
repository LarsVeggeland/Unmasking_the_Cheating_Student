The former 
 star took to social media late at night to put the world to rights.

Her fans expressed their concern as they thought it seemed out of character for the usually composed reality star. 
One noted: "Ekin it’s midnight go back to bed."
Anotgher fan exclaimed: "You are the only person who can pull off these cringe tweets"
A third fan asked: "What are these tweets babe?"
Starting a tweet with two face with tears of joy emoji's one fan sarcastically wrote: "ekin.. love your tweets!"
Whilst a fifth commented: "Ekin my love where are u getting these little sayings if ur making them up off the cuff I am so impressed."
She then took to the microblogging platform to express more late night thoughts. 
She tweeted: "Life is like looking for your phone. Most of the time, it’s in your hand."
Her fans once again expressed their concerns as one wrote: "i love that these are your 1am thoughts."
A second wrote: "Girl you need some rest!! All peace and love though"
A third noted: "Ekin its 1am."
Whilst another fan commented: "LOL Ekin when do you sleep?"
The concerning behaviour comes after 
 over contestant Ekin-Su Culculoglu’s racy pre-watershed catsuit.
The “nude” body stocking was embellished with tiny mirrors to protect her modesty — but it was too little for some.
