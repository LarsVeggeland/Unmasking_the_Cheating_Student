POUNDLAND is one of Britain’s best-loved budget stores – but more than half of its stock no longer costs a quid.
The chain’s owner Pepco Group has admitted that 58 per cent of items sold in the year up to September 2022 were outside its signature £1 price point. 
The revelation came as shoppers face further squeezes on their finances, with a recent Which? investigation finding that some basic groceries have now gone up by nearly a third. 
So is 
– which launched its first store in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, in 1990 – still the best place to bag a bargain? 
Or can you get more for your money at rivals 
, Savers, 
or 
? We hit the aisles to find out.
