LOVE Island fans were left baffled tonight as Olivia and Zara continued to pretend they don’t know each other.
The pair have in fact been liking and commenting on 
, suggesting they are at least aware of each other - but they are yet to acknowledge it.
On last night’s show, things kicked off between them when 
 was asked to kiss both cheeks of the islander she thought was the most "two faced".
She picked 
who did not look impressed.
When Olivia was then asked to reveal a secret about herself in the game, she took a swipe at Zara, saying: "Oh I have got a good one, I'm actually not two-faced I'm very straight up" 
And later 
still wasn't over it, stressing to the girls that she is "far from two-faced."
Tonight they discussed the row and smoothed things over, but those watching at home insisted they were both acting.
One person said: “I’m so confused bc olivia and zara know each other in the real world so wtf r are playing?”
Another added: “Look at Olivia and zara acting like they don’t know each other😒”
While a third commented: “Olivia maybe the reason is that you know her but you acting brand new 😂😂 and she knows you acting.”
“WHAT FAKE ACTING WAS THAT??? Zara and Olivia know each other outside,” raged a fourth person.
