EASTENDERS fans have broken down in tears after the police dropped a bombshell on Linda Carter.
The Queen Vic landlady - who is played by actress Kellie Bright in the BBC soap - returned to Walford this week after leaving following Mick’s disappearance at sea.
But in tonight’s episode the police had an update and it wasn’t good news.
“There’s been a development,” the detective said as he approached Linda in the pub.
“This washed up on the shore,” he said as he handed over a soggy wallet to Linda.
“Unfortunately most of the things were destroyed by water damage.”
Linda sat in a stunned silence as she went through the wallet and realised with horror that it was Mick’s.
Though despite the police’s words, Linda pulled out a perfectly preserved picture of the Carter family when they first moved to Walford.
And when she saw another picture, it was too much for Linda and she burst into tears.
She fled the Vic in tears cradling the picture of her and Mick together from when they were teenagers.
Alfie and Sharon comforted her in the Square, letting Linda let her emotions out.
She finally realised that Mick was gone and wouldn’t be coming back.
The emotional scenes left fans in floods of tears.
