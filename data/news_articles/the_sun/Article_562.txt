KATIE Price has revealed she'll never run again after shattering both of her feet in a horror accident.
The 44-year-old was pretending to gallop around her hotel complex like a horse while on holiday with ex Carl Woods in 2020, when 
and plunged 20ft onto concrete.
She required emergency surgery, spent 10 months in a wheelchair and needed to learn to walk again.
While she's now in a much better place, she's still feeling the impact of the accident and will do for the rest of her life.
Speaking to 
, she said: "The metal work is irritating my foot. I had the metal work taken out of one of my feet last week. I'm waiting for that to repair and then the other one. I can still horse ride, but I can’t run again."
Recalling some of the toughest moments of her recovery, she said: "I went to B&Q and got garden pads as I was crawling around on my knees. 
"Being in a wheelchair, people do treat you differently. Getting on the toilet, in and out the bath was impossible. Some days I was embarrassed. I felt vulnerable."
As she 
 on her left foot in London late last year 
revealed her wound was bleeding through her bandages.
Taking to Instagram, she posted a picture and wrote: "Trying to rest my foot from my op but when I see the blood I get worried."
Not only is Katie contending with her nasty foot issues, but she is due to head to court for a bankruptcy hearing on February 9.
The hearing - at London’s Royal Courts of Justice - was originally due to be held in June. Katie is believed to have amassed debts in excess of £3 million.
