THERE'S more than one way to rock a Skims dress, as one fashionista discovered. 
Though she technically wore the 
"wrong," viewers were thrilled by her creative hack.
Beauty brand founder and lifestyle influencer Imaan (@imaanduh) used TikTok to share 
 hack.
Standing in front of the mirror, Imaan modeled the super-popular 
, $88.
But she pointed out an intentional, unconventional choice she'd made when styling the dress.
Though the dress came with a gently sloping square neck, Imaan was wearing a high-neck black slip.
When she turned around, it revealed her styling decision: she'd put it on backward.
Since Imaan wore the dress reversed, the scooped neck revealed a section of her back and shoulders.
The influencer said she even prefers wearing the Skims dress this way to facing it the "right way" forward.
"No dress malfunctions in 2023," she said in the video's description.
Viewers were thrilled by her ingenuity, even if it meant they'd be spending instead of saving.
"My wallet is screaming," one commenter wrote, before ordering herself to log off the skims website.
"Two ways to wear it – more reasons to buy it," another piped up.
"Me with my back tattoo thinking about buying this overpriced dress," a commenter confessed.
"Kim did her thing," another Skims admirer wrote.
"I love doing this with my dresses," a fellow fashion fan said. "It just be looking so much better."
"Makes it classy," one viewer commended Imaan.
"It does!" the influencer agreed. "I love the high neckline."
