LOVE Island beauties Zara and Olivia lock horns tonight in a tense showdown over hunky Tom.
Olivia is feeling the heat after 
wasted no time getting to know the footballer following her arrival in the villa.
 stakes her claim tonight when she interrupts new couple Zara and Tom and asks to speak with her. 
She says: “I feel tension. I feel like you’ve come in here and come for me a bit.” 
Continuing, Olivia tells Zara that her comment at the re-coupling that
 had made his feelings clear didn’t go unnoticed.  
But Zara says: “He’s made it quite clear, he’s quite affectionate from the get go, you can be a classy lady but some people take that as you’re not interested, he’s taken that as you’re not interested.”
Olivia responds: “I think that’s personal between me and him and I don’t really think that’s your business.”
It's not the only awkward chat tonight.
Following David’s sudden exit at an eventful recoupling, Lana heads over to chat to Tanyel about choosing Ron. 
She says: “Obviously it’s not nice and you’re like my best mate in here, me and Ron have been happy and now you two are going to be coupled up so I feel like from now on me and you need to have a really transparent relationship.”
Lana asks 
 “You must be feeling it to have picked him in the first place?”
Tanyel explains: “I need to give it a chance the same way I would give anyone else a chance.”
Lana adds: “The only thing that would hurt me now is if things were going on behind my back, I’d just like to know.”
With Lana and Ron no longer an official coupling in the Villa, what will it mean for their budding romance now Tanyel is in the picture?
